                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watchmaking is a trade that goes back to the 16th Century, and building mystique and legitimacy on a long, historical legacy is a common theme we find in many companies that make watches today — particularly those whose roots reach back for a century or more. But which companies have really been making watches the longest? In a way, it’s a sticky question, one that can lead one into a minefield of semantics and trivia. Jaquet Droz, for example, claims a founding date of 1738 but the modern version of the company was established in 2000 when Swatch Group acquired the name. A. Lange &amp; Söhne carries on the tradition of the original company founded in Saxony in 1845 but has really been in operation only since 1990 (and to be fair, the company is very transparent about this). The Swiss-based Graham brand traces its legacy all the way back to the London atelier of British watchmaker George Graham in 1695 but has no connection to it other than design inspiration. In assembling the following list of the oldest watch brands still making watches today, I went with the companies that, in my judgment, can legitimately claim a direct lineage to the original founding, even allowing for ownership changes and periods of dormancy along the way. Without further ado, here is a countdown of the 15 oldest watch brands in the world today; you may be surprised by who is included as well as by who is excluded.</span></p><h4><strong>15. Zenith (1865)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Chronomaster-Sport-blackdial-2_4e9978ea-d1fc-4fa9-855b-997585a0ce56_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715625133" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p>Zenith's founder Georges Favre-Jacot was only 22 when he founded the maison now known as Zenith in 1865. It was one of the first watch factories to integrate all aspects of the watchmaking process under one roof, from case manufacturing to movement production to final casing and assembly, Zenith has long prided itself on its quest for timekeeping precision, earning a record number of chronometry prizes over the years, and its most influential contribution to watchmaking history is the El Primero chronograph caliber, released in 1969 as the first chronograph movement with automatic winding. This foundational achievement for the brand helped it forge through the Quartz Crisis years and into the recent revival of the luxury mechanical watch. Zenith has built much of its modern collection around the El Primero and its simpler offshoot, the Elite, and since the caliber’s 50th anniversary in 2019 it has heavily relied on some of those now-iconic and collectible El Primero watches to guide the growth of its core Chronomaster and Defy collections. Less renowned but just as distinct are Zenith’s Pilot watches, which received a contemporary makeover in 2023.</p><h4><strong>14. TAG Heuer (1860)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/TAG-Heuer-Carrera-Glassbox-2_f2570fba-15c5-4f19-957d-52a300fde02f_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715625227" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company we now know as TAG Heuer began in 1860, founded by Edouard Heuer; “TAG” would be added to the family business’s name in 1985, when the Techniques d’Avant Garde (TAG) Group obtained a majority share. Many, albeit not all, of the firm’s most influential and memorable watches were born in the pre-TAG era, the brainchildren of founding family scion and former CEO Jack Heuer, who ramped up the brand’s involvement in motorsports and race timing. Foremost among these are the Carrera, launched in 1964 and named after a treacherous road race; and the Monaco, inspired by the Monaco Grand Prix and famously worn by Steve McQueen in the 1971 auto-racing movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le Mans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TAG Heuer has also dabbled in aviation-style watches, with the Autavia, and diving watches, with the Aquaracer. While mechanical watches, many of them chronographs, remain at the core of TAG Heuer’s identity, the “Avant Garde” aspect has not been forgotten: TAG Heuer was one of the first traditional Swiss watchmakers to enter the smartwatch arena, launching its multi-purpose and versatile TAG Heuer Connected Watch in 2015 and offering updated and optimized versions of it in the subsequent years.</span></p><h4><strong>13. Panerai (1860)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/7-Panerai-Brands_5551762d-c396-4479-b282-71364f7c40b9_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715625412" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officine Panerai could be considered one of the watch industry’s oldest overnight successes. Tracing its roots to 1860, when it was established as a watch shop and watchmaking school in Florence by Giovanni Panerai, the company started making watches at the request of the Italian military shortly thereafter. Worn by frogmen of the Royal Italian Navy, Panerai’s original model, the Radiomir, took its name from the proprietary luminescent material (originally developed for use in firearms) applied to its dial to enhancer underwater legibility. The Radiomir, one of the first dive watches, was superseded by the Luminor, which added a newer luminescent dial material and a patented crown protection device to seal the case against water penetration. These watches, originally built for Panerai by Rolex, were exclusively available to military clients until 1997, when Panerai was swallowed up by Richemont and finally started offering its watches for commercial sale. When the modern-day Luminor and Radiomir caught the eye of alpha-male Hollywood actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone — and worn on screen in their blockbuster films — Panerai’s status as a luxury watch brand with masculine, retro-military appeal was assured.</span></p><h4><strong>12. Omega (1848)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Omega-Speedmaster-Moonwatch-2_d8d58a5d-ff91-4608-b2e2-d258d5c66fe3_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715625905" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p>Few Swiss luxury watch brands have had more historical impact on our popular culture than Omega, founded by Louis Brandt in 1848 (and taking up the name Omega, from one of the Brandt firm’s leading calibers, in 1903). One of the watch industry’s most trend-setting leaders, Omega created some of the first minute repeaters and tourbillons for the wrist, and was the first to use the revolutionary co-axial escapement in its calibers. By far its best known watch model is the Speedmaster Professional, aka the “Moonwatch,” which in 1969 became the first watch worn on the moon and has been a mainstay of NASA space missions ever since. Omega has been a timing partner of the Olympics since 1932 and regularly releases collectible special editions in concert with the Games. Since 1995, Omega has been the official watch of James Bond, with both Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig sporting the naval-inspired Seamaster model in various iterations on the big screen. In recent years, Omega has upgraded its in-house movements to “Master Chronometer” status, a prestigious certification that speaks to their robustness, accuracy, and industry-leading levels of resistance to magnetic fields.</p><h4><strong>11. Cartier (1847) </strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Santos-Dumont-Rewind-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715626050" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartier enjoys a worldwide reputation as the “King of Jewelers and the Jeweler of Kings,” but its founder, Louis-François Cartier, was a watchmaker first. The company, founded in Paris in 1847, is responsible for some of the most iconic and influential timepieces in history and continues to build on that legacy to this day. One of those icons sprung from a request by pioneering aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont to his friend Louis Cartier, grandson of the founder, for an easily readable watch he could wear during balloon flights. Cartier’s answer, today called the Santos watch and first marketed to the public in 1911, is now regarded as the first purpose-built aviation watch as well as the first </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/best-mens-watches?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_luxury-watch-brands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wristwatch aimed at men</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Santos begat the square-cased Tank watch in 1919, an Art Deco-era milestone that continues to exert its influence over watch design today, and the Pasha in 1932, one of the earliest and most stylish waterproof watches. Cartier has also in more recent years distinguished itself with in-house high complications like the “Mysterious” movements at which it has excelled, in which the dial elements appear to float in midair thanks to cleverly obscured mechanical parts.</span></p><h4><strong>10. Ulysse Nardin (1846)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Ulysse-Nardin-Freak-One-2_abe1a26d-7b0e-4bb4-8ac6-e7442355297d_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715626504" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A watch </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maison</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose very name conjures up romantic images of seagoing adventure and oceanic exploration, Ulysse Nardin, founded in 1846 by its eponym, carved out its place in Swiss watch history as a revered maker of marine chronometers for many of the world’s navies in the 19th and 20th centuries. Long regarded as the “standard bearer of nautical timekeeping,” Ulysse Nardin also entered the 21st Century as one of the most technically innovative and boldly experimental watchmakers on the scene. In 2001, Ulysse Nardin shook up the watch world with its introduction of the Freak, a wildly unconventional timepiece with a “flying carrousel system” in which there are no hands, only a baguette-shaped movement rotating on its own axis, with a bridge to indicate the minutes, while a rotating disk mounted on the mainplate indicates the hours. The Freak was also one of the first watches to use silicon for several of its vital movement parts, a material now widely used in the industry. The brand’s maritime history lives on in the Diver and Marine Torpilleur models, many of which are designed to echo the look of classical marine chronometers, with Roman numerals, cathedral hands, and a stacked arrangement of subdials. The Freak and its various descendants, like the recently released Freak One, remain the flagships of the fleet, displaying the pinnacle of avant-garde <em>haute horlogerie.</em></span></p><h4><strong>9. Patek Philippe (1839)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/31-Patek-Philippe-Brands_3df7c42b-d05a-4e5e-a946-a2a8941e31b3_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715627328" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 1839, Patek Philippe has been a leader in high watchmaking, pioneering many complications and design elements that are now seen widely throughout the watch industry. Polish watchmakers Antoine Norbert de Patek and Francois Czapek partnered to form the original company, Patek, Czapek, &amp; Cie.; French horologist Jean Adrien Philippe, who invented the keyless winding and setting system still standard on watches today, joined in 1845, and the Genevan </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been known as Patek Philippe ever since. The Stern family, who purchased Patek Philippe in 1939, still own and operate it today and have built it into what is almost certainly the most prestigious Swiss luxury watchmaker and definitely the one most valued on the auction scene. Patek Philippe’s array of complications, found mostly in its elegant and historic Calatrava line  in production since 1932) but also in some pieces within the sportier Nautilus and Aquanaut collections, include annual calendars, perpetual calendars, chronographs, world-time functions, minute repeaters, and, in some of its most coveted and priciest watches, combinations of two or more of the above. Patek created the first annual calendar and the first wristwatches with a perpetual calendar and a split-seconds chronograph. The Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010 contained no less than 20 complications and sold for $31.19M in 2019.</span></p><h4><strong>8. Jaeger-LeCoultre (1833)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Jaeger-LeCoultre-Heliotourbillon-2_db0c6712-400c-4112-9ab9-e28fb8ca3e8e_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715628403" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaeger-LeCoultre, established in 1833 in the heart of the Vallée de Joux in the Swiss Jura Mountains, has been called “The Watchmaker of Watchmakers,” and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maison</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has worked hard to earn the reputation, producing more than 1,242 in-house calibers over its long history — and for much of that history supplying some of them to other major heritage brands like Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin. Jaeger-LeCoultre’s most iconic watch is undeniably the Reverso, made since 1931 and recognizable by its swiveling, reversible case, which was initially conceived as a sports watch for polo players to wear during matches. Another signature innovation from Jaeger-LeCoultre came in 1968: the Polaris Memovox, a diver’s watch equipped with a mechanical alarm, which exerts its aesthetic and technical influence on an entire collection of Polaris sport-luxury models today. On the technical side, Jaeger-LeCoultre is responsible for some of modern high horology’s most advanced innovations, several patented, like the twin-barrel, dual-escapement Duomètre winding system, and the triple-axis Heliotourbillon; and is lauded for its rigorous 1,000-hour “Master Control” testing regimen.</span></p><h4><strong>7. Longines (1832)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Longines-Spirit-Zulu-Time-39mm-green-2_bd2b596d-f00c-4944-a814-b0efd2330760_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715629588" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headquartered in Saint-Imier, Switzerland since its founding in 1832 by Auguste Agassiz, Longines takes its name from <em>“les longines,”</em> or the “long meadows” that surround that picturesque Swiss village. The brand has been a pioneer in sports timing throughout its history, developing timing technologies for racing and a host of equestrian competitions as well as being a one-time Olympic Games timekeeper. Longines remains heavily involved in equestrian sports today, acting as official timing partner of horse racing’s Triple Crown and other events. The company also looks back on an enviable history of involvement in early aviation, designing the legendary Hour Angle watch with Charles Lindbergh in 1931 and supplying watches to pilots like Howard Hughes, Amy Johnson, and Amelia Earhart; these watches inspired the popular Spirit collection models that take pride of place in Longines’ portfolio today. Longines was also one of the first Swiss brands to embrace quartz technology in the 1950s, with its line of Conquest VHP (Very High Precision) quartz-powered models. All together, this collection of history and savoir-faire yields a very versatile collection of both distinctly modern and charmingly retro timepieces, all offering immense value for their price.</span></p><h4><strong>6. Baume &amp; Mercier (1830)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Baume-_-Mercier-Clifton-Moon-Phase-2_69996c22-590d-442b-a9fc-98ed1d3ea8b5_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715630771" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p>Brothers Louis-Victor and Célestin Baume founded Frères Baume in 1830 and partnered with Paul Mercier in 1918 to form the Baume &amp; Mercier firm that we recognize today. The firm became one of the first to dabble in shaped watch cases and to design jewelry-oriented watches specifically aimed at women. Since joining the Richemont Group in 1988, Baume &amp; Mercier has offered tastefully designed Swiss-made timepieces at solid values compared to many of its peers, including complications from day-dates to chronographs to a perpetual calendar, all outfitted with outsourced Swiss-made calibers and modules. In recent years, Baume &amp; Mercier has forayed into making its own in-house calibers, including the so-called Baumatic movement that it has installed inside several models within its sporty-elegant Clifton collections, like the recently launched Clifton Moon Phase models. In 2021, Baume &amp; Mercier revived its Riviera model from 1973, its own answer to the mega-popular trend of integrated-bracelet sports watches, adding a chronograph in 2022 and a diver’s watch, the Riviera Azur, in 2023.</p><h4><strong>5. Girard-Perregaux (1791)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Girard-Perregaux-Laureato-2_28f213da-90a8-4909-a12c-c82fcfd0f449_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715631634" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long and somewhat convoluted history of Girard-Perregaux begins in 1791, when watchmaker Jean-François Baute established a watchmaking atelier under his name. Another watchmaker, Constant Girard, founded Girard &amp; Cie. in 1852, which became Girard-Perregaux after he married Marie Perregaux in 1854. Constant’s son took over the company in 1906 (still following?) and acquired the Baute company to merge it into the family firm. This series of business maneuvers allows the modern Girard-Perregaux to claim a pedigree back to 1791 even though neither Girard nor Perregaux had yet been born. In any case, Girard-Perregaux boasts an undeniably historic pedigree in the annals of high horology, the most notable being the Three Gold Bridges Tourbillon, Constant Girard’s patented, award-winning take on Abraham-Louis Breguet’s hallmark horological invention, the tourbillon; the “Bridges” design continues to influence Girard-Perregaux’s watch innovations today from both an aesthetic and technical standpoint. A more recent milestone, the Laureato sport-luxury watch, conceived in the 1970s’ heyday of that genre, has since its 2016 relaunch taken up the leader position in Girard-Perregaux’s collection, with recent models designed in collaboration with the brand’s automotive partner, Aston-Martin.</span></p><h4><strong>4. Breguet (1775)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Breguet-Tradition-7097-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715632122" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abraham-Louis Breguet (1747 - 1823) was one of the most important figures in the history of watchmaking and his signature invention, the tourbillon, finds some of its most creative and ambitious expressions in the modern Breguet watch brand, whose history can be traced all the way back to 1775. (Patented in 1801 as a solution to the effects of gravitational fields on a watch’s movement precision, the tourbillon is of course now a staple of many other watchmakers as well.) Breguet made the first watch to be wound by means of its crown in 1830, an era in which watches were wound with a key, and Breguet watches throughout history have adorned the waistcoats and wrists of important figures from England’s King George III to Queen Marie-Antoinette to Sir Winston Churchill. The <i>maison</i> even established its own signature set of hands, called Breguet hands, back in 1783, which are found on pieces from Breguet’s modern Classique collection as well as models from many other brands. In addition to its well-curated selection of tourbillon-equipped timepieces (like the super-thin “Extra-Plat” Classique references) and rare complications like the world-time Hora Mundi and its Equation of Time models, Breguet produces luxury with both a nautical and a classical aeronautical flair with its Marine and Type XX collections, respectively. </span></p><h4><strong>3. Vacheron Constantin (1755)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-Historiques-CDV-2_fc166163-f6d3-4bf8-accb-1dabf81846ba_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715632788"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to some others on this list, Vacheron Constantin, founded in 1755 by Jean-Marc Vacheron and François Constantin, can boast an uninterrupted history of watchmaking, from its origins to today. Now well into its third century, Vacheron Constantin can also claim a number of horological milestones and wearers drawn from the ranks of royalty, like Egypt’s King Fuad I. Vacheron Constantin’s Ref. 57260 pocket watch, unveiled in 2015, holds the title of the world’s most complicated watch ever made, packing 57 total complications. Vacheron Constantin offers one of the most comprehensive lineups among high watchmaking brands, with pieces in its Patrimony and Traditonnelle collections that range from elegant three-handers to perpetual calendars, minute repeaters, and tourbillons. Its sport-luxury Overseas collection, which draws its influence from </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/vacheron-constantin-historiques-222?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_luxury-watch-brands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the legendary 222 reference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 1977, encompasses its own raft of complications, and the vintage-inspired Historiques series engages enthusiasts with modern re-editions of classical timepieces from Vacheron’s extensive archives like the Historiques Cornes de Vache, which revives an Art Deco-era wrist chronograph in its original gold case, with bicompax dial and “cow-horn” shaped lugs.</span></p><h4><strong>2. Favre-Leuba</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Favre-Leuba-Bivouac-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715696965" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p>Probably the least well-known watchmaker on this list is also the second-oldest in the world (by a scant two years). Abraham Favre founded his independent atelier in 1737 in Le Locle, Switzerland, after years as an apprentice. His son Abraham, Jr., partnered with Auguste Leuba in 1815 to form the joint company that exists today. It would remain in the hands of the Favre family for eight generations before being sold in the 1980s, and contributed several notable watches throughout its long history, including the Bivouac in the 1960s, the first mechanical wristwatch equipped with a barometer and an altimeter to measure air pressure. Favre-Leuba also made some notable dive watches in the ‘50s and ‘60s, like the Deep Blue and Bathy, the latter of which could measure dive times, durations, and depths. After years of dormancy, the firm re-emerged in 2011 under new ownership by the India-based Tata Group (which makes cars as well as many other products) and its watchmaking subsidiary, the Titan Company. Today, Favre-Leuba has revived many of its past models in contemporary form, like the Raider Harpoon dive watch, with an impressive 500-meter water resistance, and a modern version of the Bivouac, capable of measuring altitudes to an astonishing 9,000 meters above sea level and of measuring a wearer’s elevation with a built-in aneroid barometer that reacts to air pressure.</p><h4><strong>1. Blancpain (1735)</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Blancpain-Fifty-Fathoms-42-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715696911" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinction of being the oldest existing watchmaker goes to Blancpain, founded in 1735 by Jehan-Jacques Blancpain, years before the United States was even a country. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maison</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers a plethora of small and high complications  in its extensive and elegant Villeret collection, named for the Swiss village where it originated before moving to the Vallée de Joux in 1983, including a so-called “complete” calendar, a signature complication. These days, however, Blancpain is perhaps best known for the milestone it contributed to watch history in 1953 — </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/blancpain-fifty-fathoms?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_luxury-watch-brands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Fifty-Fathoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the very first purpose-built diver’s watches. Designed in collaboration with the French Navy’s Nageurs de Combat (combat swimmers, and later worn by U.S. Navy SEALs and other American military diving units, the Fifty Fathoms has become a pillar of Blancpain’s product range today. A subfamily based on a particular model from the late 1950s, called Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe, has a more modest, retro look and has become a popular collection on its own. For the model’s 70th anniversary in 2023, Blancpain released a special “bronze gold” limited edition of the Fifty Fathoms and followed that up with a crowd-pleasing, more wearable 42mm version in 2024.</span></p><p><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Just missing the cut of the top 15, and rounding out the top 20, are IWC, founded in 1868; Piaget (1874); Audemars Piguet, Bulova (both 1875); and Seiko (1881). Breitling comes along in 1884, and Rolex, not until 1905, making it the second-oldest watchmaker founded in the 20th Century, one year behind Oris, established in 1904. </span></i></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotting watches in the movies, on the wrists of our favorite actors and often playing key roles in the film’s storyline, has long been a favorite pastime of cinephiles and watch enthusiasts, and identifying these movie watches, often all the way down to each model’s individual reference number, has become an online cottage industry. This compilation in no way purports to be the most comprehensive list of every movie watch ever, but it does spotlight some of the most noteworthy watches worn on the silver screen over the past sixty-plus years. Without further ado, let’s grab our popcorn and dive into the list, in more or less chronological order from the 1960s to today. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1"><i data-mce-fragment="1">Blue Hawaii (1961)</i></b><b data-mce-fragment="1"> - Hamilton Ventura</b></h4><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Hamilton Ventura" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Ventura-2_e14be75a-dbe9-4193-bcd1-9e6efd1e8358.jpg?v=1691587904"></span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">American watchmaker Hamilton introduced the first electronic watch, the Ventura, to great fanfare in 1957, and the watch would go on to even greater fame when it was worn by Elvis Presley — at the time, arguably the biggest star in the world — in the 1961 film, </span><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Hawaii.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Elvis Presley with Hamilton Ventura" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Elvis-Presley-Hamilton-Ventura-2.jpg?v=1691591563"></span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The watch, which is believed to be Presley’s own rather than a prop (see above), was notable not only for its unusual, futuristic curved case design but for its movement, Caliber 500, which used a battery, magnets, and an electronic coil rather than a mainspring to drive the gear train and balance wheel. The Ventura remains a presence in Hamilton's collection today, though modern models are now equipped with quartz or mechanical movements rather than the now-outdated electronic mechanism. It remains one of the most uniquely iconoclastic designs in the watch world, with the lightning-bolt motif on its dial and the shield-shaped case that calls to mind the contours of a guitar.</span></p><h4><b><i>Le Mans (1971)</i></b><b> - TAG Heuer Monaco</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="TAG Heuer Monaco" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/TAG-Heuer-Monaco-2_290881f4-9019-4e04-9d46-2be4362430c2.jpg?v=1691587941"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TAG Heuer Monaco made its debut in 1969 but really ascended to pop cultural icon status two years later, when legendary actor and “King of Cool” Steve McQueen wore the colorful wrist chronograph for his role as racing driver Michael Delaney in the 1971 movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le Mans.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Steve McQueen TAG Heuer Monaco ad" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Steve-McQueen-LeMans-Heuer-2.jpg?v=1691591058"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Monaco, named for the Monaco Grand Prix, was the first wristwatch with a water-resistant square case, as well as one of the first chronograph watches to be equipped with a self-winding mechanical movement, namely the historic Caliber 11 that also animated the TAG Heuer Carrera and Breitling Chrono-Matic. Its chronograph pushers were placed on the right side of the case while the crown was positioned unconventionally on the left. While the movement inside has changed, to the in-house Caliber Heuer 02, with an impressive 80-hour power reserve, and its architecture positions both pushers and crown on the right side, the Monaco’s 39mm square case has remained largely the same, as has the dial, with the same two squared chronograph subdials that McQueen used to time his laps in the movie.</span></p><h4><b><i>Jaws (1975)</i></b><b> - Alsta Nautoscaph</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Alsta Nautoscaph" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Alsta-Nautoscaph-AS-2.jpg?v=1691587978"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The granddaddy of all summer blockbusters, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaws</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hit the big screen in 1975 and its impact on moviemaking and pop culture is still felt to this day. The movie made a household name of its director, Steven Spielberg; inspired a generation’s fear and fascination with shark attacks; and contributed scenes and quotes that are still memorable (i.e., “You’re gonna need a bigger boat”). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Jaws Movie Poster" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Jaws-movie-poster-2.jpg?v=1691592095"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After movie watch-spotting became a thing, identifying the unusual diver-style watch worn by Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper was nearly as much of a challenging hunt as the one in the movie for the man-eating great white shark. Ultimately, the timepiece was confirmed to be a Nautoscaph model from New York-based Alsta Watch Company (watch photo via <a href="https://www.analogshift.com/">Analog/Shift</a>), which was resurrected in 2017 as a British brand. Among the modern brand’s offerings are a revived version of the “Jaws” Nautoscaph, with a 38.8mm steel case, rotating divers’ bezel, and the original’s steel bracelet with perforated links. There’s even a shark etched onto the solid caseback.</span></p><h4><b><i>Apocalypse Now (1979)</i></b><b> - Rolex GMT-Master Ref. 1675 and Seiko Diver Ref. 6105</b></h4><p><b><img alt="Seiko Prospex Captain Willard" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-Prospex-Captain-Willard-2.jpg?v=1691592519"></b></p><p>Francis Ford Coppola’s legendary and notoriously trouble-plagued Vietnam war epic, loosely based on Joseph Conrad’s novella <em>Heart of Darkness,</em> has contributed not one but two storied timepieces to watch-enthusiast culture: the Seiko dive watch worn by Martin Sheen as Army Captain Benjamin Willard, and the Rolex GMT-Master on the wrist of Marlon Brando as Willard’s quarry, renegade Colonel Walter Kurtz. The former was the Ref. 6105, a chunky steel dive watch with an asymmetrical case and a 4 o’clock crown that was actually worn by U.S. troops during the Vietnam war; the model lives on today as the Ref. SPB153 from the sporty Prospex series (above), with a 42.7mm steel case, an automatic movement, and a military-green dial and divers’ bezel.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Marlon-Brando-Rolex-Apocalypse-Now-2.jpg?v=1691592736" alt="Marlon Brando Rolex Apocalypse Now" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Marlon-Brando-Rolex-Apocalypse-Now-2.jpg?v=1691592736"></p><p>Brando’s GMT-Master, on the other hand, is of a style no longer made by Rolex, with a GMT hand and a cyclops lens but a plain, stationary metal bezel rather than the familiar bicolor “Pepsi” bezel. The actual watch that Brando wore as Kurtz eventually sold at auction for nearly two million dollars.</p><h4><b><i>Alien (1979)</i></b><b> - Casio F-100</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Casio Alien Watch" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Casio-Alien-Watch-2_6e2d2172-7e0e-4eda-b0f4-eea6936a46e8.jpg?v=1691588219"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining classic sci-fi with envelope-pushing horror elements, Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em> was an influential film best remembered for the H.R. Giger-designed titular alien and for Sigourney Weaver’s ass-kicking performance as astronaut Ellen Ripley, which she later reprised in three sequels. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Alien-Movie-Poster-2.jpg?v=1691602858" alt="Alien 1979 movie poster"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the award-winning original, Weaver wore a Casio F-100 digital watch, a model that was discontinued right around the time the movie came out but which lives on in the modern A100 from Casio’s historically influenced Vintage series. Today’s version pays tribute to its predecessor, which was notably the first Casio watch with a resin case, while adding some modern elements, including metallic components replacing some of the original’s resin ones. The four-button mini-dashboard under the main LCD time display, a hallmark of the F-100, is retained in the newer model, which packs an array of useful displays, from stopwatch to alarms to button-operated LED light.</span></p><h4><b><i>Back to the Future (1985)</i></b><b> - Casio CA-50 “Calculator Watch”</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Casio Calculator Watch" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Casio-Calculator-Watch-2_b68e4ebb-8a69-4434-8a0b-409378f82802.jpg?v=1691588252"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A touchstone of the digital-driven 1980s, more popularly known as the Calculator Watch, Casio’s CA-50 was the perfect accessory for time-traveling hero Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) in Robert Zemeckis’ sci-fi romp, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the Future.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (The model’s successor, the similarly designed but more water-resistant CA-53W, is the watch worn in the two sequels, and would bring the “Calculator Watch” back into the pop cultural conversation decades later when it was </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/walter-white-watch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">worn by Bryan Cranston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Walter White in the TV series </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking Bad)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Michael J.

Its rectangular black resin case with reticulated strap resists water pressure to 50 meters. With its black miniaturized keyboard, the watch’s front face calls to mind early cell phones and Blackberries — appropriate, as this humble Casio model, with its range of functions that include stopwatches, multiple time zones, and alarms in addition to the calculator, anticipated the rise of the smartphone and, eventually, the smartwatch.</span></p><h4><b><i>Commando (1985), Predator (1987)</i></b><b> - Seiko H558-5000 “Arnie”</b></h4><p><b><i><img alt='Seiko Prospex "Arnie"' src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-Prospex-Arnie-New-2_ce2322ba-b621-42d1-824b-3b42e50d1643.jpg?v=1691588291"></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger wore a bulky, multifunctional, now-discontinued Seiko watch on his massive wrist in at least two testosterone-filled blockbusters in the 1980s, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commando</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predator. </span></em></b></p><p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Predator Movie Poster" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Schwarzenegger-Predator-poster-2.jpg?v=1691591121"></span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The watch, Reference H558-5000,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gained the nickname “Arnie” among Seiko aficionados for its appearance in those films and inspired a contemporary re-edition from the Japanese brand’s sporty, performance-focused Prospex collection. The modern Ref. SNJ025 retains the original’s bulky "tuna can'' case (emblematic of many Seiko divers since the 1960s) and the analog-digital display while replacing its standard quartz movement with a modern, solar-powered version. At 47.8mm in diameter and 51.3mm lug to lug, the Prospex’s steel case is even larger than the original’s, which measured just under 46mm; Arnold would likely approve. An ISO-certified dive watch with a 200-meter rating. its array of functions includes a 1/100-second chronograph, daily alarms, a full calendar, and an LED illuminating light function.</span></b></p><h4><b><i>Top Gun (1986), Top Gun: Maverick (2022)</i></b><b> - Porsche Design Chronograph One</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Porsche-Design-Chronograph-I-2_c9f77bf5-7112-48d8-a14b-ce0361e1f44c.jpg?v=1691588331" alt="Porsche Design Chronograph One" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Porsche-Design-Chronograph-I-2_c9f77bf5-7112-48d8-a14b-ce0361e1f44c.jpg?v=1691588331"><br>In Tony Scott’s era-defining blockbuster <i>Top Gun,</i> Tom Cruise stars as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, who competes to be the top fighter pilot at the U.S. Navy’s elite Naval Fighter Weapons School while also wooing his beautiful flight instructor (Kelly McGillis). The watch he wears in the movie (and in its very popular 2022 sequel) is one that was designed with auto racing rather than flying in mind. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Top Gun scene" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Top-Gun-Tom-Cruise-2.jpg?v=1691594474"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Porsche Design Chronograph One was one of the first timepieces designed by Ferdinand Alexander (“Butzi”) Porsche, who designed the iconic Porsche 911 and later founded the Porsche Design Studio in 1973. Originally produced in partnership with the Orfina Swiss watch company, it was one of the very first steel watches with a black PVD coating, a forerunner of the many black-on-black “stealth” watches of today, and features elements inspired by car dashboards, including the prominent tachymeter scale. Presumably, Maverick chose the watch for its no-glare, matte-black exterior, which would have reduced reflections in the cockpit during aerial combat maneuvers.</span></p><h4><b><i>The Abyss (1989)</i></b><b> - Seiko 6309 “Turtle”</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Seiko Prospex Turtle" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-Turtle-2.jpg?v=1691594851"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Cameron (who’d later play a key role in the <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/sea-dweller-vs-submariner">history of Rolex dive watches</a>) directed this blockbuster about a diving team attempting to retrieve a lost nuclear submarine when they encounter an otherworldly presence at the bottom of the ocean. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="The Abyss Movie Poster" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/The-Abyss-poster-2.jpg?v=1691595094"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed Harris, in his leading role as team leader Virgil “Bud” Brigman, appropriately wears a sturdy divers’ watch in the film, a Seiko Ref. 6309, nicknamed “Turtle” for its cushion-shaped case with rounded corners. The “Turtle” has been around in some form since 1976 and has become one of Seiko’s most enduringly popular divers’ watches. The modern SRP versions, launched in 2016 (example above), are a part of Seiko’s Prospex collection and feature hefty 45mm cases and 200-meter water resistance. That’s just slightly bigger than the watch Harris wore in the movie and the big luminous indexes, and screw-down crown at 4 o’clock, remain the same. </span></p><h4><b><i>Apollo 13 (1995)</i></b><b> - Omega Speedmaster Professional “Moonwatch”</b></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Omega-Speedmaster-2_74093a9d-8ac8-478b-89dd-49cb982d7310.jpg?v=1691588380" alt='Omega Speedmaster "Moonwatch"' data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Omega-Speedmaster-2_74093a9d-8ac8-478b-89dd-49cb982d7310.jpg?v=1691588380"><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I cover in much more detail </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/omega-speedmaster"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Omega Speedmaster became legendary as the first watch worn on the moon in 1969’s Apollo 11 mission, and has been part of every astronaut’s equipment kit in every NASA mission since. In April 1970, the Speedmaster made history a second time, as dramatized in the 1995 movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apollo 13, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Apollo 13 movie poster" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Apollo-13-movie-poster-2_8d847804-0d1d-4fc3-b697-48c74febc737.jpg?v=1691595171"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eponymous mission depicted in the film, the third space flight bound for the moon, experienced a potentially fatal equipment failure when an oxygen tank exploded, crippling the service module that provided life-sustaining functions to the crew. The original lunar landing mission had to be aborted and the explosion had thrown the spacecraft dangerously off course. With time running out, Commander Jim Lovell (portrayed by Hanks) executed a risky maneuver to ensure a safe landing: a fuel burn of precisely 14 seconds’ duration that would reorient the spacecraft to a safe angle for a return to Earth’s atmosphere. The onboard clock had malfunctioned, so the Speedmaster worn by fellow astronaut Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) was pressed into service to time the crucial interval for the burn. The desperate gambit was successful, and the crew managed to return safely to Earth for a real-life Hollywood ending.</span></p><h4><b><i>Daylight (1996)</i></b><b> - Panerai Luminor Marina</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Panerai Luminor" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Panerai-Luminor-2_a5055638-8cfc-4472-8b86-e14da60a2cf6.jpg?v=1691588418"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in Florence in 1860, Panerai was a watch brand mostly unknown to the general public, doing most of its business as a provider of military dive watches for Italian navy frogmen throughout the 20th Century. The brand found mainstream popularity and a rabidly enthusiastic following, however, after actor Sylvester Stallone famously wore a Panerai Luminor Marina in his lead role in the 1995 movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight. </span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Sylvester Stallone Panerai - Daylight" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Sylvester-Stallone-Daylight-2_1544e329-fba2-41f3-8f23-bb4d5b979edf.jpg?v=1691595273"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch industry legend has it that Stallone discovered the watch at an Italian retailer while filming the movie in Rome and took such a liking to its robust, military look that he ordered an additional 200 more directly from Panerai, with his signature engraved in the caseback, to hand out as gifts to other cast and crew members. These very rare and collectible Luminor models are now known as “SlyTechs.” The Luminor is recognizable for its “sandwich”-style dial with stencil-style hour markers, its stately cushion-shaped case, and its patented crown-protecting bridge device that helps ensure the screw-down crown’s water resistance, which is put to the test in a harrowing sequence in the film in which Stallone’s character is trapped in a collapsed, flooding tunnel.

With a 42-mm case, an even more in-your-face tapisserie textured dial, and, for the first time ever in a Royal Oak watch, a chronograph movement, the watch projected an aggressively sporty spirit that spoke to a new generation. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="End of Days movie poster" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/End-of-Days-poster-2.jpg?v=1691595854"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arnold Schwarzenegger, at the height of his ‘90s box-office dominance, was a big fan of the watch and even worked directly with Audemars Piguet’s design team to create the watch now known as the Royal Oak Offshore “End of Days.” He wore the massive, all-black timepiece with yellow details in the supernatural thriller film of the same name, in his starring role as an alcoholic ex-police detective battling a banker — who’s really Satan — from conceiving the Antichrist with a young woman before midnight on New Year’s Eve of the new millennium (it's just as crazy as it sounds).</span></p><h4><b><i>American Psycho (2000)</i></b><b> - S</b><b>eiko 5 SNXJ90 (standing in for Rolex Datejust)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-5-SNXJ90-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715610006"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on a 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis, the darkly comedic</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> American Psycho</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stars future Batman Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, an obsessively competitive New York City investment banker who moonlights as a serial killer. Among Bateman’s most notable badges of wealth and power are the watch he wears, which is purported to be a steel-and-gold Rolex Datejust, a timepiece regarded now, as then, as a go-to accessory for the executive class. (In the novel that inspired the movie, Bateman refers to the watch as a Rolex on several occasions.) </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Christian Bale Rolex American Psycho" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patrick-Bateman-Rolex-2.jpg?v=1691596240"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, further probing by watch spotters in recent years has unearthed the timepiece’s true identity, as a vintage Seiko 5 Ref. SNXJ90, a much more affordable alternative to the Datejust. (Apparently, Rolex was not on board with its brand being associated with such a reprehensible, murderous character.) The Japanese-made watch bears a more than passing resemblance to Rolex’s icon, with a 38mm case, a gold-tone fluted bezel, white dial with day-date display, and five-link Jubilee-style bracelet with a gold-plated center links. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the lead character’s very dark proclivities, and the fact that his coveted watch was in essence an impostor, the movie helped supercharge the Rolex Datejust’s popularity among young, ambitious Wall Streeters of the era. </span></p><h4><b><i>Blood Diamond (2006)</i></b><b> - Breitling Chrono Avenger</b></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Breitling-Chrono-Avenger-2.jpg?v=1691603726" alt="Breitling Chrono Avenger"></p><p>The title of this politically tinged cinematic thriller refers to the “blood diamonds” mined in war zones to finance international conflicts — and not to any precious stones found on the watch worn by star Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler and mercenary Danny Archer, a Breitling Chrono Avenger whose exact reference is unclear.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Blood-Diamond-DiCaprio-2.jpg?v=1691603790" alt="Blood Diamond Leo DiCaprio"></p><p>The watch has a 44mm titanium case on a robust brown strap — ideal for traipsing through the harsh jungles of Sierra Leone — and a black dial with a blue-tinted crystal. The bezel has the emblematic rider tabs that are today found on the Chronomat series and the dial features a lineup of three subdials to display chronograph readings; the stopwatch itself is operated via the pushers that flank the crown. Breitling revamped the Avenger family in 2019 with elements drawn from its sister Colt collection, but pre-owned examples of Leo’s movie watch can likely still be found at some dealers.</p><h4><b><i>Interstellar (2014)</i></b><b> - Hamilton Khaki Field Murph</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Hamilton Khaki Field Murph" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Khaki-Field-Murph-2_408f4627-4cde-400f-b68c-03e31cd06141.jpg?v=1691588688"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among watch manufacturers, few have contributed as many memorable timepieces worn on big (and small) screens as Hamilton. One of the most prominent examples can be found in the Christopher Nolan-helmed sci-fi adventure </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interstellar,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starring Matthew McConaughey as ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper and Jessica Chastain as his daughter, Murphy “Murph” Cooper. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Interstellar movie poster" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Interstellar-Movie-Poster-2.jpg?v=1691596643"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Khaki Field Murph Automatic (now offered in both a 42mm and 38mm size), takes its nickname from Chastain’s character and is, for all intents and purposes, an exact replica of the watch featured in the movie, with a steel case, a black dial with nickel-coated cathedral hands and applied Arabic numerals, and a black leather strap with a pin buckle. The notable but subtle difference is the seconds hand, upon which the Morse code for the word “Eureka” is subtly printed in lacquer, a reference to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interstellar’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> climatic scene in which Murph uses the Hamilton watch to, essentially, save world by using it to send coded signals.</span></p><h4><b>Darkest Hour (2017) - Breguet Pocket Watch No. 765</b></h4><p><b><img alt="Breguet Churchill Pocket Watch" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Breguet-Churchill-Pocketwatch-2.jpg?v=1691588738"></b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winston Churchill’s early days as Great Britain’s wartime prime minister are the subject of the epic drama </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darkest Hour,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Gary Oldman, one of our most talented and chameleon-like actors, inhabiting the role of Churchill in an Academy Award-winning performance. The real Churchill, it turns out, was partial to a Swiss Breguet pocket watch that was originally made for his grandfather, the seventh Duke of Marlborough, and carried it on his person almost constantly. When today’s Breguet got wind of the production, its watchmakers decided to rebuild the classic timepiece (above), which Churchill’s family nicknamed “the Turnip,” for Oldman to wear in his scenes. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Darkest Hour Gary Oldman as Churchill" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Darkest-Hour-Gary-Oldman-2.jpg?v=1691597012"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The yellow-gold watch is period-accurate in nearly all of its exterior elements, down to the enamel dial and the Duke of Marlborough’s coat-of-arms engraved on the caseback. Subtle differences from the original (which is safely under glass at the Imperial War Museum of London) include the lack of a grand complication movement — a bit of overkill for a watch that’s essentially a prop — and the Breguet logo on the dial, a tiny anachronism that nevertheless gives the brand some well-deserved screen time.</span></p><h4><b><i>Venom (2018)</i></b><b> - Bremont U2/51 Jet</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Bremont U2/51-Jet" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Bremont-U251-Jet-2.jpg?v=1691588777"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bremont is a British watchmaker known to celebrate Britishness, as evidenced by its line of watches named for and inspired by the U.K.’s military history. Thus it shouldn’t be a surprise that one of Britain’s most admired and multi talented actors, Tom Hardy, wears the U2/51 Jet timepiece in his leading role in the 2018 Marvel/Columbia action film </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venom.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Venom-Tom-Hardy-Bremont-2.jpg?v=1691603209" alt="Tom Hardy as Venom"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardy plays Eddie Brock, a disgraced journalist who merges with an alien symbiote to become a black-clad, rougher-edged version of Spider-Man, the nightmarish, shadow-dwelling Venom. In keeping with the darkness of the character, Brock’s watch, from Bremont’s aviation-inspired U2 collection, is a veritable stealth bomber for the wrist, with a jet-black case of DLC-coated steel and similarly ebony-tinted dial with fax-lume numerals and indexes. A smoked crystal covers the caseback, revealing the movement, and the watch is mounted on a black rubber strap.</span></p><h4><b><i>Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019)</i></b><b> - Vintage Citizen 8110A Automatic Bullhead</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Bullhead-Chronograph-2.jpg?v=1691605943" alt="Citizen Bullhead Vintage"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quentin Tarantino, who wrote and directed, used the shocking 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders as the basis for this epic dramedy about an aging movie star (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime stunt double (Brad Pitt) as they navigate their way through a changing Hollywood film industry and find themselves caught up in the looming threat of the Manson family. Pitt wore a very period-appropriate piece for the era the film depicted, a vintage Bullhead chronograph watch from Japanese watchmaker Citizen (photo above via <a href="https://www.chrono24.com/">Chrono24</a>). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Brad-Pitt-Citizen-Bullhead-2.jpg?v=1691606044" alt="Brad Pitt Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The watch has a gold-plated case, a matching gold dial with black subdials, and a motorsport-inspired tachymeter ring. Also evoking the spirit of auto racing are the two top-mounted pushers, that give the watch its “Bullhead” designation: they’re reminiscent not only of a bull’s horns but also of a hand-held stopwatch used to time racing laps. While Citizen has long since discontinued the model used in the movie, the brand offers modern versions in its current Tsuno collection. </span></p><h4><b><i>No Time to Die (2022)</i></b><b> - Omega Seamaster Diver 300M “007 Edition”</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Omega Seamaster Diver 007 Edition" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Omega-Seamaster-2_9100be63-3c4f-4fd9-9126-2ffbd06e88ad.jpg?v=1691588824"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you might be thinking, "Where are all the James Bond watches?" Certainly, the watches worn by the various lead actors in the long-running James Bond film franchise are deserving of a category all their own (and I strongly encourage Bond fans to check out my much-more-comprehensive <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/james-bond-watches">feature on 007’s cinematic watches</a> if you’re interested in the full history) but for the purposes of this article, we’ll spotlight the most recent Bond film, Daniel Craig’s final turn as Agent 007, the much-anticipated and COVID-delayed <i>No Time to Die.</i></span><img alt="James Bond Daniel Craig Omega Seamaster" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/James-Bond-Omega-Seamaster-2_b687df4e-8c75-47f3-b1b4-4b3b3b4be540.jpg?v=1691597620" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/James-Bond-Omega-Seamaster-2_b687df4e-8c75-47f3-b1b4-4b3b3b4be540.jpg?v=1691597620"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in every movie since 1995’s <i>Goldeneye,</i> when Omega began its relationship with James Bond, the titular superspy wore an Omega Seamaster, in this instance the titanium-cased Seamaster Diver 300M “007 Edition” a watch for which Craig himself contributed ideas to the distinctive design, whose signature elements include a scalloped-edge rotating divers’ bezel with an aluminum insert, a brown “tropical” dial with vintage-hued lume, and a British armed-forces-inspired “broad arrow” marking above 6 o’clock — a nod to Bond’s backstory as a British naval officer.</span></p><h4><b><i>The Gray Man (2022)</i></b><b> - TAG Heuer Carrera</b><img alt="TAG Heuer Carrera Calibre 5" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/TAG-Heuer-Carrera-wrist-2.jpg?v=1691608894" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/TAG-Heuer-Carrera-wrist-2.jpg?v=1691608894"></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Gosling is known for being a style icon, and the watch he wears in the Russo Brothers’ 2022 spy thriller </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gray Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is equal parts elegance and sportiness — a three-handed version of the iconic TAG Heuer Carrera, the first of which debuted in 1964 as one of the era’s most trend-setting chronograph watches. This one from the Calibre 5 series is much more sober in its look, with a silver-toned dial sporting central baton hands and a date window at 6 o’clock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Ryan-Gosling-TAG_Heuer-promo-2.jpg?v=1691608975" alt="Ryan Gosling wearing TAG Heuer"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The steel case is a moderately large 39mm, making it very versatile for Gosling’s various costume changes in the movie, in which he plays a spy trained by a covert CIA group on the run from a sadistic assassin formerly from the same secret group. Gosling announced his role as a “brand ambassador” for TAG Heuer shortly before the movie began shooting, so look for more TAG Heuer watches on Ryan Gosling characters in the future (apparently, he sported at least three of them in his Ken role in 2023’s biggest summer flick, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your favorite movie watches that are missing on this list?

                <![CDATA[<p>For most of us, the art and science of watchmaking is simply the technical underpinning behind the timepieces that fascinate us as enthusiasts, hobbyists, and collectors — an esoteric and intricate world delved into at varying levels of interest based on our individual curiosity about, and/or understanding of, the mechanisms involved. For some, however, learning how to assemble, repair, or perhaps even build a watch from scratch is an obsession that can lead to a lifelong and very fulfilling career as a trained watchmaker and repairer— and to put it bluntly, the watch industry needs more of them. Here are the 10 state-accredited educational institutions in the U.S. offering full-time curricula for watchmaking careers as compiled by the Horological Society of New York. </p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Gem City College School of Horology, Quincy, IL</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Gem-City-College-Horology-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715355322" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><em><strong>Photo: <a href="https://www.awci.com/">AWCI</a></strong></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gem City College was founded in 1870 as Gem City Business College by Civil War veteran DeLafayette Musselman, whose name still adorns one of the campus buildings. Located in the city of Quincy, adjacent to the Mississippi River, the College added its horology school in 1961, which was a department that had actually migrated over from Bradley University in neighboring Peoria, as well as a cosmetology program in 1975, expanding from its original business model of training students in business-specific courses like banking, penmanship, and accounting. Today, the Horology School offers courses in watchmaking and watch repair, clock repair, jewelry design, engraving, and diamond-setting. Graduates of Gem City’s program, which is supported by The American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute (AWCI) have gone on to positions at Bulova’s Illinois service center, among other outlets.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">More info here: </span><a href="http://www.gemcitycollege.com/horology-school/" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="http://www.gemcitycollege.com/horology-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.gemcitycollege.com/horology-school/</span></a></p><h4><strong>Lititz Watch Technicum, Lititz, Pennsylvania</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Lititz-Technicum-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715703840"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nestled in Eastern Pennsylvania’s Amish country — not far from Lancaster, one of American watchmaking’s most historical former hubs — the Lititz Watch Technicum opened its doors in 2001, initially as a subsidiary of Rolex, which founded it to address a growing need for classically trained watchmakers in the United States. The 3,000-hour course — which is free to students, who need to purchase their own watchmaking tools and housing — focuses on micromechanics and the servicing of high-luxury mechanical watches, with a particularly strong emphasis on chronographs. The 54,000-square-foot facility, designed in the rural-barn style of its bucolic surroundings by award-winning architect Michael Graves, is also home to a large Rolex service center. Since its opening, Lititz has turned out more than 115 trained after-service watchmakers, most finding employment at Rolex service centers or other high-end facilities or brands. With the opening of the new training center in Dallas (see below), the future role of Lititz Technicum is unclear. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More info here: <a href="https://www.rolex.org/science/an-education-in-precision">https://www.rolex.org/science/an-education-in-precision</a></span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Nicolas G.

Hayek (1928 - 2010) was a titanic figure in the history of the watch industry, perhaps best known as the executive whose business acumen as the creator of Swatch, and eventually as founder of the Swatch Group, rescued the Swiss watchmaking business from ruin during the Quartz Crisis in the 1970s and ‘80s. Hayek’s name now appears on an international group of watchmaking schools — six of them, scattered across three continents — established in 1999 and owned and operated by the Swatch Group. Miami, Florida, where the majority of Swatch Group brands are now headquartered, is the site of North America’s sole facility. In its quarter-century existence, more than 1,000 professional watchmakers have emerged from NGH’s programs, which operate under the the WOSTEP curricula as described below and range from the basics of micromechanics, to the adjustment and assembly of complications like calendars and chronographs, to final casing. Many graduates today ply their trade at prestigious brands owned by the group, such as Omega, Longines, Breguet, Blancpain, and Harry Winston.</p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">More info here: </span><a href="https://www.swatchgroup.com/en/career/nicolas-g-hayek-watchmaking-schools" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="https://www.swatchgroup.com/en/career/nicolas-g-hayek-watchmaking-schools"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.swatchgroup.com/en/career/nicolas-g-hayek-watchmaking-schools</span></a></p><h4><b>North American Institute of Swiss Watchmaking, Fort Worth, TX</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/North-American-Watchmaking-School-FortWorth-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715362974" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><em><strong>Photo: <a href="https://300magazine.com/">300 Magazine</a></strong></em></p><p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of two major watchmaking schools in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex (along with the RWTC, profiled below), the North American Institute of Swiss Watchmaking was created in a partnership between the Neuchâtel-based Watchmakers of Switzerland Training and Educational Program (WOSTEP) and the Swiss-owned Richemont Group, the luxury conglomerate that owns watchmaking heavyweights including Cartier, IWC, and Jaeger-LeCoultre. WOSTEP’s comprehensive and world-famous training program incorporates just about every aspect of horological expertise, from repair to polishing to finishing techniques, to micromechanical and precision adjustment. The Institute and the NGH facility in Miami are the only WOSTEP-certified schools in the U.S., and watchmakers with a WOSTEP certificate are generally in  high demand. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More info here: </span><a href="https://www.wostep.ch/en/ecoles-partenaires/iosw-north-american-institute-swiss-watchmaking-fort-worth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.wostep.ch/en/ecoles-partenaires/iosw-north-american-institute-swiss-watchmaking-fort-worth</span></a></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"></span><b>North Seattle College Watch Technology Institute, Seattle, WA</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/North-Seattle-Watchmaking-School-exterior-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715357064" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accredited two-year institution established in 1970, North Seattle College offers a full-time program comprising 3,000 academic hours for aspiring watchmakers, supported through a partnership with Rolex Watch U.S.A. and the SAWTA (Swiss American Watchmakers Training Alliance) curriculum that it established in 2008. Students learn vital skills such as watch movement repair, case and bracelet refinishing, dialing and casing, water resistance testing, and general customer service. Past graduates of either the 164-credit Certificate program or the 184-credit Associate of Applied Science in Watch Technology degree have found employment at high-end retailers, including those in the Rolex network, as well as repair centers nationwide. </span></p><p>More info here: <a href="https://northseattle.edu/programs/watch-technology-institute"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://northseattle.edu/programs/watch-technology-institute</span></a></p><h4><b>Patek Philippe Horology Program of New York, </b><b>New York, NY</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Watchmaking-NYC-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715352359" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an eye toward the future of watchmaking, and because “the skills required to service, repair and restore Patek Philippe watches are much the same as those required to make one,” according to its official release, Swiss </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Patek Philippe established its Horology Program in the heart of midtown New York City (where the brand’s offices are also based) in 2015; it was the second such training center founded by the maison after the first one opened in Shanghai in 2013. Apprentices in the two-year program learn a comprehensive set of horological disciplines, from machining to delicate manual skills, and develop proficiency in working with all types of Patek Philippe movements, mechanical and quartz. Graduates will be trained to successfully repair Patek Philippe watches up to “Level 2,” which is up to and including self-winding models like the Calatrava Ref. 5116R, with the option to continue to higher levels of complication at subsequent courses in Geneva. As one might expect of a curriculum run by Patek Philippe, it is highly competitive and exclusive: six watchmakers were chosen out of a pool of 300 applicants in the first class of 2015.</span></p><p>More info here: <a href="https://www.patek.com/en/retail-service/services/our-commitment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.patek.com/en/retail-service/services/our-commitment</span></a></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><b>Rolex Watchmaking Training Center, Dallas, TX</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Watchmaking-School-Texas-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715352053" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b></b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Established in 2023 and welcoming its first class of future horologists in the fall of 2024, the Rolex Watchmaking Training Center (RWTC) hosts an 18-month, tuition-free program “to prepare and educate the next generation of certified Rolex watchmakers.” The Dallas-based school employs nine full-time instructors with decades of watchmaking experience and boasts a well-rounded course curriculum that includes up to six full months of hands-on servicing work on Rolex timepieces. All the courses, which going forward will begin annually in September and March, culminate with a final exam at Rolex HQ in Geneva, surely a bucket-list trip for many an aspiring watchmaker. Best of all, graduates of the 15-person courses are likely to find themselves on the shortlist for full time employment at one of the Crown’s network of service centers across the United States. </span></p><p>More info here: <a href="https://www.rolexwatchmakingtrainingcenter.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.rolexwatchmakingtrainingcenter.com/</span></a></p><h4><b>Texas Institute of Jewelry Technology, Paris, TX</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Paris-Jewelry-Technology-Institute-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715365251" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><em><strong>Photo: <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/">Texas Monthly</a></strong></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This community college in the county seat of Lamar County in northeastern Texas started offering both watchmaking and jewelry making classes back in 1942.

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Zenith has streamlined its various product families while at the same time introducing a range of styles, materials, and colorways to appeal to as wide and diverse an audience as possible. What has been conspicuously absent from the </span><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> lineup for more than a few years, however, has been an honest-to-gosh, purpose-built dive watch. At Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva 2024, Zenith filled this long-unoccupied niche in its portfolio — with the Defy Extreme Diver models, which we cover in detail <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/zenith-watches-wonders-2024">here,</a> and with the modern incarnation of the vintage watch that serves as their template, the Defy Revival A3648. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Diver-vintage-ad-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712345730" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Zenith launched the Defy collection in 1969, the same milestone year the venerable Swiss </span><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> made its most significant contribution to horological history with the debut of El Primero, the world’s first self-winding, high-frequency chronograph caliber. The Defy Ref. A3648, the fledgling family’s first dive watch, hit the market the same year. As I explore in much more detail </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/zenith-defy" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/zenith-defy"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">here,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> the Defy collection underwent numerous changes over the years, and dive watches as a genre largely disappeared from Zenith’s product portfolio by the end of the 20th Century. In recent years, Zenith has produced a handful of Defy Revival editions, resurrecting notable models from those early days, and the latest is one that it’s safe to say almost no one was expecting: the modern iteration of Zenith’s first Defy dive watch.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Revival-A3864-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712345942" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring a period-appropriate 37mm in diameter and featuring the angular, octagonal steel case of the original Defy family, the Defy Revival A3648 features a stationary 14-sided bezel positioned above a rotating steel bezel with a dive scale on an orange insert made of sapphire. The black markings on the orange insert matches the color scheme of the vintage watch’s scale, though the insert on the vintage watch was made of Plexiglas. Also evoking the unconventional design of the original A3648 is the placement of the screw-down crown at 4 o’clock, helping this historically influenced dive watch achieve the same water-resistance rating as its ancestor: 600 meters, a level that was quite impressive back in 1969 and still uncommon in dive watches today. (And go figure: 600 meters is also equivalent to 1,969 feet, making for a serendipitous reference to the Defy’s launch year.) </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Revival-Diver-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715191922"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">According to Zenith CEO Benoit de Clerck, whom I spoke to shortly after the watch's launch in Geneva, it's actually tested to an even higher level of robustness. "We test all of these watches to 750 meters," de Clerck says, "which is a big difference in terms of pressure if you are a diver, almost 40 more pounds per square inch of pressure on the watch. The fact that 600 meters is equivalent to 1,969 feet is something the watch's creators knew 55 years ago when it launched — not marketing, but reality. <meta charset="utf-8"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Of course, this was very complicated to achieve back then, even to get instruments that could make such a measurement. </span>That's why you can still find some vintage models of this watch with both measurements on the dial: 600 meters and 1,969 feet."</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Revival-A3864-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712346184" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The watch boasts this level of underwater robustness despite its case being constructed to incorporate a sapphire pane in the caseback, a visual bonus that is hardly ever found on a watch designed to withstand such depths of pressure — and, of course, one that was not present on the 1969 original. "To Zenth, the open caeback has always been a signature, representing quality and advanced technology," de Clerck explains. "Not many watch brands have an open caseback [for their dive watches], because it definitely creates a weak point. But we were unafraid to add it. The way the case is assembled is very technical and difficult, but it's constructed in a way that the more pressure is put on it, the more it clinches and contracts upon itself; the higher the pressure, the deeper the watch goes, the more resistance is locked in. Of course, the [sapphire] glass is also very, very thick." </span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The caseback window offers a view of the movement, Zenith’s automatic Elite 670 Caliber, a three-hand descendant of El Primero with a date display at 4:30 and a 50-hour power reserve. Like previous models in the Defy Revival series, the Defy Revival A3648 comes on a five-link steel bracelet with a folding buckle, modeled after the bracelets made by the Swiss firm Gay Frères in the ‘60s and ‘70s for many Zenith watches. The Zenith Defy Revival A3648 carries a retail price of $7,700.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Revival-A3864-side-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712346225" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>]]>

            <title>17 Day-Date Watches From Under $200 to Over $50,000</title>

                <![CDATA[<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, we are living in a “less is more” era of watch design, in which watch dials continue to trend toward symmetry and simplicity; an era in which even the humble date window, the simplest and perhaps most utilitarian complication for an everyday-wear watch, has found itself unwelcome to many enthusiasts of this new generation of understated timepieces. And yet, the appeal of the day-date watch — one notch of complication above the simple date-display model, designed to clue in the wearer not just to the date on the calendar but the day of the week — remains strong. From a utility standpoint, it shouldn’t be surprising, especially in our current fast-paced era, in which home-office work and 24/7 connectedness blurs lines between weekdays and weekends more than ever, and forgetting what day it is becomes an issue for more and more people. If you’re in the market for such a watch, or just intrigued by the diverse ways in which a timepiece can display this useful information, check out the list below, in which we spotlight a selection of day-date watches, from entry-level to high luxury, in ascending order of price.</span></b></p><h4><b>Timex Q Timex Inspired SST</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Timex-Q-Timex-2_ccba891d-c80a-42f7-8fc7-1c57dd40ed40_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715017665" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $179, Case Size: 38 mm, Case Height: 11.5 mm, Lug Width: 18 mm, Crystal: Acrylic, Water Resistance: 50 meters, Movement: Quartz Analog</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timex has had success in recent years in reproducing some of its cult-favorite vintage models for today’s increasingly savvy collectors seeking out the sweet spot between historical flair, modest dimensions, and value-oriented pricing. Among them is the colorful and sporty Q Timex, a modern reissue of a popular day-date model from the 1970s, which also happens to be one of Timex’s first models with a quartz caliber (hence the "Q"). Among the elements that echo the original ‘70s models are the bicolor 12-hour rotating bezel, diver-style geometrical indexes on the dial, the woven-style, integrated stainless steel bracelet (that’s the “SST” in the name) and even the battery case cover in the back, which enables the wearer to change his own battery with the simple turn of a coin edge.</span></p><h4><b>Citizen Eco-Drive Garrison</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Garrison-3_80bd9585-71cb-41ec-8ad3-fe8ba26262f7_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715017754" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $220, Case Size: 42 mm, Lug width: 21.5mm, Crystal: Mineral, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Eco-Drive Caliber E101</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizen’s Garrison watch lives up to its military-inspired name with its adoption of classical field watch and pilot’s watch elements, including the large, legible Arabic hour numerals and wide syringe-shaped hands with luminous coating. The day-date display at 3 o'clock adds a contemporary utilitarian touch. The big case, here in Citizen’s proprietary Super Titanium, adds to the mission-ready look with a brushed finish and fastens to the wrist with a brown calfskin leather strap with contrast stitching, à la early aviation watches and their modern descendants. The Garrison is also one of the very few Citizen watches that offer the Japanese brand’s proprietary light-powered Eco-Drive movement for under $250.</span></p><h4><b>Seiko 5 Sports SRPD51 </b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-5-Sports-SRPD51-2_fa4b81ae-d0b9-4ba4-9695-e3e15d447a0b_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715017807" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $295, Case Size: 42.5mm, Thickness: 13mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Lug-to-Lug: 46mm, Crystal: Hardlex, Water Resistance: 100 m, Movement: Automatic Seiko 4R36</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seiko retired its much-beloved SKX lineup of dive watches in 2019, concurrently with the relaunch of the updated Seiko 5 Sports range. The SRPD51 retains much of the spirit as well as the design language of the discontinued SKX007, one of fandom’s favorite entry-level mechanical dive watches, albeit with scaled-back specs to accommodate the price point. The blue dial of this model harmonizes with the blue aluminum ring of the unidirectional diver’s bezel. The blue/blue combo is something new that wasn’t offered in SXX models; also new are the applied hour markers and logo, replacing the painted ones of the watches’ predecessors, and the clear caseback that displays the automatic Caliber 4R36. The day/date display at 3 o’clock and recessed crown at the unusual 4 o’clock position are two of the five attributes that define the 5 Sports collection, which started with the original Sportsmatic 5 model in 1963.</span></p><h4><b>Hamilton Khaki Field King Auto</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Khaki-Field-King-2_63d3492a-abfe-4e23-ab83-341a469a6a92_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715017964" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $695, Case Size: 40mm, Thickness: 11.5mm, Lug to Lug: 48mm, Lug width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 50 meters, Movement: Automatic Hamilton Caliber H-40 (ETA 2834-2 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamilton’s Khaki Field family of military-inspired timepieces takes its direct inspiration from a watch made in the 1960s and worn by troops during the Vietnam War. The day-date versions of the watch can be found in the Khaki Field King subfamily, whose watches offer a larger size (40mm) than the fairly modest three-hand Khaki Field models (38mm) and are outfitted with the automatic H-40 movement. In addition to the array of colorways and strap or bracelet options — including the model featured, with sober black dial and brown calfskin strap with contrast stitching —  the King models arrange the day and date in a distinctive fashion, with the former in a curved window like the Rolex Day-Date and the latter directly beneath it in a small window, a layout that leaves intact the inner 24-hour ring that identifies the Khaki collection.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><h4><b>Tissot Heritage Visodate</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tissot-Heritage-Visodate-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715018022" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $695,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case size: 42mm, Thickness: 12.1mm, Lug Width: 21mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Automatic Powermatic 80.121</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evoking the styles of the 1950s — and specifically reimagining a model from 1957 — the Heritage Visodate is among the most value-conscious Swiss-made automatics on the market, from a watchmaker that has staked out a substantial role in that space. Its dial’s vintage Tissot logo at 12 o’clock immediately calls attention to its historical roots, along with the sharply angled Dauphine hands and thin, trapezoidal hour indexes. The prominent, dual day-date window is a nod to modernity, replacing the simple date display of the original watch. The matte white dial of this model is gently curved to echo the contours of the domed sapphire crystal. The ETA-based Powermatic 80 movement, its rotor etched with the same retro Tissot logo as the dial, is on display through a transparent caseback.</span></p><h4><b>Mido Ocean Star Tribute</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Mido-Ocean-Star-Tribute-red-2_c450d04f-c90f-4951-a2f1-46ecd52280f3_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715018083" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $990 - $1,200, Case Size: 40.5mm, Thickness: 13.4mm, Lug Width: 21mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Mido Caliber 80</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mido launched the first Ocean Star dive watches in 1959 and paid homage to these early  models with the Tribute models, which debuted in 2019, the 75th anniversary of the Ocean Star trademark. Ocean Star Tribute watches can be distinguished from the standard Ocean Star Automatics by their more retro elements paying tribute to the models of the 1960s. The dial has an inverted triangle rather than a doubled rectangular index at 12 o’clock and the paddle-style hands are not openworked, though they (and the indexes) are luminous-coated. The case dimensions are 40.5mm — smaller than the 42.5mm of the non-Tribute Ocean Stars — and several of the dials are finished in an appealing gradient effect. Tribute models are equipped with the Powermatic Caliber 80 movement,which powers their three-handed time display and day-date indication in a dual window at 3 o’clock. The watches are mounted on either a vintage-look steel mesh bracelet or a synthetic rubber strap.</span></p><h4><b>Rado DiaStar Original</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rado-DiaStar-Original-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715023374" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $1,550, Case Size: 38mm, Thickness: 12.1mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Rado Caliber R764 (ETA Powermatic 80 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rado has commanded a longstanding recognition as the first brand to seriously incorporate ceramics into its watchmaking repertoire, and it all started with the introduction of the original, historic DiaStar watch in 1962. Rado touted the DiaStar as “the world’s first scratch-proof watch,” owing to its use of sapphire for its crystal (a rarity at the time) and of a tungsten-carbide, metal-ceramic-hybrid “hardmetal” for its unusually shaped case; the latter material would set the stage for the High-Tech ceramic that Rado uses today. In 2022, Rado paid tribute to the trailblazing DiaStar on its 60th anniversary, introducing a modern edition heavily influenced by the original, with a handful of modern updates, including the brushed motif on the dial, the ETA-based movement with 80-hour power reserve, and an unconventional day-date display, in which the day abbreviation is stacked in a vertical arrangement above the 6 o’clock date numeral. The period-appropriate 38mm case is made of Ceramos, a highly lustrous ceramic-metal composite that opens up the door for many bold color choices.</span></p><h4><b>Marathon Arctic Edition Jumbo Day-Date Automatic</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Marathon-Arctic-Day-Date-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715021382"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,100, Case Size: 46mm, Thickness: 18mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Sellita Caliber SW220</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1939, Canada-based Marathon Watch has been making timepieces for the North American market and since 1941 has been supplying them to the U.S. armed forces. Designed in Canada and manufactured in Switzerland, Marathon watches have become well regarded for their military durability and mission-ready precision. The Arctic Edition of the brand’s Jumbo Day Date (JDD) model features a bright white dial with a 24-hour (military time) scale on the flange, around the main dial’s 12-hour display; hands and indexes with Tritium H3 micro-gas tubes for a brighter and more lasting nighttime glow than dials that use the more common Super-LumiNova; and its namesake oversized day-and-date calendar at 3 o’clock, equipped with a rapid corrector.for both displays. The unidirectional, 60-minute dive-scale bezel is also highly readable in the dark, with Maraglo paint illuminating its 12 o'clock orientation triangle, and the Swiss-made automatic Sellita SW200-1 does its duty inside the steel case.</span></p><h4><b>Maurice Lacroix Pontos Day Date</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Maurice-Lacroix-Pontos-Day-Date-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715093190" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,250, Case Size: 40.5mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Caliber ML143 (Sellita SW200 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maurice Lacroix offers a distinctively stylish day-date model in its sporty Pontos collection, known for its sector-dial designs. The Pontos Day-Date, coming in at a midrange 40.5mm size, has applied baton hour markers surrounding an inner minute ring (in a contrasting color to the main dial), interrupted by a date window at the 6 o’clock position. Inside the circle, above the center point of the hour and minute hands, is a curving window displaying the day of the week, fully spelled out rather than abbreviated. The case’s stepped lugs connect it to either a three-link steel bracelet or a color-coordinated nylon strap.</span></p><h4><b>Tudor Royal Day-Date</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Royal-Day-Date-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715092114" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,575, Case Size: 41mm, Thickness: 10.6mm, Lug Width: 10mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber T603 (ETA 2834-2 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tudor founder Hans Wilsdorf introduced the watch that inspired the Tudor Royal way back in 1926 — predating the Oyster Prince Submariner that inspired the brand’s better known Black Bay models by decades. The Royal, which was first called by that name in 1950, is one of Tudor’s dressier watches while still fairly “sporty-chic” in its design, with its fluted stationary bezel and sunray-finish dial with Roman numeral hour markers. The largest iteration of the Tudor Royal, at 41mm, features a day-of-the-week display in an arched window at 12 o’clock and a small date aperture at 3 o’clock, a layout no doubt inspired by the original Day-Date “President” created by Tudor’s parent brand, Rolex (covered in more detail below). The movement is the ETA-based Caliber T603, with a modest but solid 38-hour power reserve.</span></p><h4><b>Ball Engineer Master II Skindiver Heritage</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Ball-Engineer-II-Skindiver-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715109090"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,949, Case Size: 42mm, Thickness: 15.2mm, Lug to Lug: 53mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Caliber RR1102-C (ETA 2836-2 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now based in Switzerland, Ball Watch traces its origins to 1891 in the United States, where it was founded by Webster Clay Ball, a Cleveland jeweler and Chief Inspector for the Lake Shore railway line. The company built its reputation on its dependably accurate “Railway Standard” watches, worn by train conductors and other railroad workers throughout the early 20th century. This dedication to “industrial function” drives the brand to this day, and is evident in models like this day-and-date-equipped dive watch, the Master II Skindiver Heritage. The model’s 42mm steel case resists water pressure to 300 meters and magnetic fields to 80,000 A/m, and its dial opts for the highest level of legibility in dark conditions, with an array of tritium-filled  micro-gas distributed throughout the hands and hour markers. Beating inside the robust case is an automatic, Swiss-made caliber with a COSC certificate for chronometric performance, a rare bonus at this watch’s price point. </span></p><h4><b>TAG Heuer Carrera Day-Date</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/TAG-Heuer-Carrera-Day-Date-2_a331920e-3f5b-4598-8086-3bf77dcd4264_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715026960"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,350 - $3,650, Case Size: 41mm, Thickness: 12.37mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Caliber 5 (Sellita SW200-1 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named for the treacherous Carrera Panamericana road race by its designer, founding family scion and motorsport enthusiast Jack Heuer, the TAG Heuer Carrera made its debut in 1964 and swiftly became a trendsetter in the genre of motorsport-inspired chronograph wristwatches. Resurrected as a tentpole collection for the brand in the 21st Century, the Carrera has expanded into other styles beyond its chronograph roots — like the Carrera Day-Date, which offers a step up from the simplest three-hand-date models in both case size and calendar complexity while remaining more understated on the wrist than the core Carrera chronographs. The 41mm stainless steel cases of the Day-Date are mounted on either H-shaped steel link bracelets or leather straps. The date is at 3 o’clock on this model, side by side with the day of the week, in a faceted double window, thanks to a modification of the automatic Caliber 5 in the three-hand Automatic, which also offers a quick correction of the date.</span></p><h4><b>IWC Portofino Hand Wound Day-Date</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portofino-HandWound-Day-Date-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715100351" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $13,000, Case Size: 45mm, Case Height: 13.1mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Manually wound IWC Caliber 59220</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IWC introduced the first Portofino watches in 1984, but their elegantly simple aesthetic can be traced back to timepieces from the 1940s and ‘50s, along with a groundbreaking mechanical pocket watch that it released in the heart of the Quartz Crisis 1970s. Today, the Portofino still offers a dressy, unisex character that contrasts with IWC’s more famous (and arguably more masculine) Pilot models. The Hand Wound Day Date, outfitted with IWC’s in-house Caliber 59220, debuted in 2015, in the round, almost bezel-less Portofino case in steel, at a substantial diameter of 45mm, which allows for the multiple indications on the pure white dial. These include not only the large date numeral in an aperture at 12 o’clock and analog day-of-the-week counter at 3 o’clock (the pair of calendar functions that lends the model its name), but also an indicator for the impressive eight-day power reserve at 9 o’clock and a small seconds display at 6 o’clock. The movement synchronizes the day and date disks so that it’s easy to advance them in unison. Completing the package is the leather strap, fashioned by Italian luxury shoemaker Santoni. </span></p><h4><b>Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe Day-Date Desert Edition</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Blancpain-FF-Bathyscaphe-Day-Date-Desert-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715095204" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $13,600, Case Size: 43mm, Thickness: 14.2mm, Lug Width: 23mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Caliber 1315DD</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduced in 1953, the <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/blancpain-fifty-fathoms?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_watches-under-10-000">Blancpain Fifty Fathoms</a> is considered the first modern divers’ watch, and today the historical model anchors an entire family of timepieces, including the Bathyscaphe models introduced in 2013. The Bathyscaphe subfamily, which takes its retro design cues from a model introduced in 1956, welcomed a limited edition with a day-date design in 2020. The sandy beige dial of the Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe Day-Date Desert Edition is inspired by the desert sands of Death Valley, California, where underwater photographer Ernest H. Brooks II made his famous dive into the Devil’s Hole underwater chasm in 1962. Its 43-mm brushed steel case features a dive-scale bezel insert made of brown ceramic, and the dial’s Arabic numerals, syringe hands, and day-date window evokes a vintage Fifty Fathoms model from the 1970s. Inside the 300-meter water-resistant case is Blancpain’s automatic Caliber 1315DD, notable for its silicon balance spring and five-day power reserve.</span></p><h4><b>Vacheron Constantin FiftySix Day-Date</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-FiftySix-Day-Date-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715096914" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $27,400, Case Size: 40.5mm, Thickness: 11.6mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Automatic Vacheron Constantin Caliber 2475 SC/2</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FiftySix collection, introduced in 2018, has its origins in a vintage watch from Vacheron Constantin’s vast archives, the fondly remembered Reference 6073 from 1956. Like that timepiece, the models in the modern FiftySix collection feature a case design inspired by the Maltese cross, the longtime symbol of the Swiss <i>maison,</i> with each of the curved lugs representing one branch of this 15th-century badge of honor.  Along with a three-hand automatic and a Complete Calendar, the first wave of FiftySix models brought us this unusual and elegantly appointed Day-Date model, powered by the self-winding Vacheron Caliber 2475 SC/2, which reveals both day and date in analog fashion on subdials. The sector-style dial, a hallmark of the collection, has a double opaline sunburst effect that contrasts with the two snailed counters — day of the week at 9 o’clock, date at 3 o’clock — along with the additional analog power-reserve display subtly positioned at 6 ‘clock. The movement, visible behind a sapphire caseback, continues the Maltese cross theme with its openworked rotor. </span></p><h4><b>Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 40</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Day-Date-gold-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715021985"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $38,500, Case Size: 40mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Rolex Caliber 3255</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rolex Day-Date, introduced in 1956, was the first wristwatch that displayed both the date and the current day of the week, hence ushering in the entire day-date genre to the watch industry. The original model, in a 36mm gold Oyster case, established the classic look that still defines the collection today with a fluted bezel, Roman-numeral dial, 3 o’clock date display with “Cyclops” magnifying lens, and the day featured in a curved window at 12 o’clock. The Day-Date is also known as the “President,” a nickname that it began earning in the 1960s when President Lyndon B. Johnson wore one regularly in office; the watch is still associated with heads of state and other powerful people today. The sturdy three-link bracelet that made its debut on the original Day-Date also bears the nickname “President.” Today, two sizes of the Day-Date are available: the 36mm version that carries on the spirit of the original, and the 40mm models aimed at larger wrists (pictured in 18k yellow gold); both are equipped with the ultra-modern Rolex automatic Caliber 3255.</span></p><h4><b>A. Lange &amp; Söhne Odysseus Titanium</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/A-Lange-Sohne-Odysseus-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715022029"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $56,500, Case Size: 40.5mm, Case Height: 11.1mm, Lug Width: 36mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 120 meters, Movement: Automatic Caliber L155.1</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/best-german-watch-brands-a-complete-guide?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_watches-and-wonders">Germany’s A.

A few years later, the Saxon <i>manufacture</i> followed it up with a limited edition in a titanium case and bracelet (another first) and a new “ice blue” dial. The case measures 40.5mm and its finishing is impeccable, with an array of matte, brushed, and polished surfaces. The dial sports its own distinctive finishing, with finely guillochéd grooves on the hour ring contrasting with the granular surface of the main dial and circular lines on the small seconds subdial at 6 o’clock. Inside the timepiece beats the in-house, automatic L155 Caliber, which powers the central hour and minute hands, the independent seconds subdial, and the Odysseus’ hallmark large day-and-date display, in two symmetrical windows at 3 and 9 o’clock. Visible behind a sapphire caseback, the finely decorated movement stores 50 hours of power reserve and winds its mainspring with a skeletonized, partially black-rhodiumed platinum rotor. </span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>The Tudor Black Bay took watch fandom by storm when it hit the market in 2012 and the sporty, vintage-inspired divers' watch has since grown into an extensive family with something for just about everyone, now boasting <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watch-movements" data-sanitized-target="_blank">in-house calibers</a>, multiple styles and sizes, and even some precious metals and <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watch-complications" data-sanitized-target="_blank">complications</a>. In this comprehensive guide we explore the origins of the Tudor Black Bay and showcase the standout models you can buy right now. </p><h3>FOUNDATIONS OF TUDOR</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Oyster-Prince-ad-3.jpg?v=1654870320" alt="Tudor Oyster Prince ad">With an eye toward making watches that would be affordable while still maintaining a high level of quality, Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf registered the Tudor brand trademark in 1926, and began running the Tudor company as a subsidiary brand of Rolex in 1946. Tudor watches were the only watches on the market at the time that featured reliable third-party movements inside the famed waterproof Rolex Oyster case, also developed in 1926, and were initially more geared toward the tool watch market than were Rolex timepieces, which already enjoyed a reputation as luxury items. The first Tudor watch with the “Oyster” name followed shortly after the launch of the brand, in 1947, kicking off a long tradition of timepieces suitable for underwater adventure. The first Tudor Prince model followed in 1952, around the same time that Tudor began an R&amp;D partnership with the French Navy (<em>Marine Nationale</em>), from which would emerge the brand’s first dive watch.</p><h3>THE OYSTER PRINCE SUBMARINER<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Oyster-Prince-Submariner-1954-2.jpg?v=1654801225" alt="Tudor Oyster Prince Submariner - 1954"></h3><p>The Tudor Oyster Prince Submariner, Tudor’s first dedicated divers’ watch, surfaced in 1954, one year after the debut of big brother Rolex’s own diving model, also called the Submariner, as well as another historically significant dive watch, Blancpain’s <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/blancpain-fifty-fathoms">Fifty Fathoms</a>. The first Tudor Submariner (Ref. 7922) <span>used the same familiar “Mercedes” handset found on many Rolex models</span> and was water-resistant to 100 meters; its successor in 1958, Ref. 7924, upped this rating to 200 meters, which is still the standard for Tudor dive watches today, and was nicknamed the “Big Crown,” as it was the first Tudor Submariner with an enlarged 8mm winding crown (from the previous 5mm). The watch underwent a series of mostly small evolutions in subsequent years, chiefly in details like the crown guards and dial verbiage, before its most substantial redesign in 1969. That’s the year the now-famous Ref. 7016, nicknamed “Snowflake” after its distinctive square-themed hands and markers, made its debut, remaining in Tudor’s catalog until the early 1980s and providing the template for the next decade’s worth of Submariners. Each of these landmark models would lend an element of inspiration to the Tudor Black Bay.</p><h3>BUILDING THE BLACK BAY DNA</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Burgundy-2.jpg?v=1654801449" alt="Tudor Heritage Black Bay - 2012"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Bay collection, initially dubbed the Heritage Black Bay, debuted in 2012 with the attention-grabbing Ref. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">79220R (above) — a watch that played a huge role in Tudor stepping out from under Rolex’s substantial shadow to establish an impressive identity all its own. The watch, whose burgundy-colored divers’ bezel was a bold choice at the time, provided the foundation for all Black Bay models that followed and it did so by deftly combining a mishmash of elements from several earlier Tudor dive watches. The so-called “snowflake” hour hand that is so emblematic now to the Black Bay family was drawn from the Submariner Ref. 7016 from 1969. (The oddly shaped hour hand was apparently a concession to legibility: one of Tudor’s main clients for its Submariner was the French Navy, whose divers found two distinctly different hands to be beneficial in reading the time underwater.) The large screw-down crown, with engraved Tudor rose emblem, was introduced on the 1958 "Big Crown" model. The geometrical hour markers — round dots and rectangles, with a dominant inverted triangle at 12 o’clock — are derived from Tudor Submariners on the market in the ‘60s and ‘70s, as is the subtly domed shape of both the dial and the sapphire crystal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Navy-Blue-2.jpg?v=1654802409" alt="Tudor Black Bay"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So successful was this vintage-inspired timepiece that it copped the prize for best “Revival” at the following year’s Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG). And as one would expect, subsequent years would see the growth of the Black Bay into a full collection, beginning with the next year’s model, Ref. 79220B (above), whose dark blue bezel replaced the burgundy one of its predecessor and brought the Black Bay closer to its maritime roots; and another version with a black bezel. The success of both meant that the floodgates were officially open for more versions, in different case materials, sizes, straps, dial colorways, and eventually even complications. The only missing piece — outfitting them with an in-house movement — would fall into place shortly thereafter. </span></p><h3>IN-HOUSE <i>C</i>ALIBERS &amp; VINTAGE BRACELETS</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Caliber-2.jpg?v=1654801608" alt="Tudor Manufacture Caliber"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the more affordable alternative to Rolex, Tudor had long installed off-the-rack ETA calibers in its Oyster cases, even when Rolex itself had shifted nearly all of its movement production in-house. In its first few years of existence, the Tudor Black Bay was powered by the ETA 2824, a workhorse automatic movement with a 28,800-vph frequency and a somewhat pedestrian 38-hour power reserve. Tudor’s modern forging of an independent brand identity, which began in earnest with its return to the U.S. market in 2013 after nearly a decade’s hiatus, took its most significant step in 2015 with the launch of the first-ever Tudor </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movement, Caliber MT5621. The movement, which made its debut inside the now-discontinued North Flag watch, was significant in several respects, including its 70-hour power reserve, its silicon balance spring held in place by a traversing bridge, and its COSC chronometer-certified timekeeping accuracy. The MT5621 (“MT,” as one might expect, denotes “Manufacture Tudor”) and its offspring (the MT5612, MT5601, MT5602, et cetera) now find homes in numerous Tudor watch models, including nearly every version of the Black Bay. </span></p><a data-encoded-attr-charset="dXRmLTg=" data-encoded-tag-value="" data-encoded-tag-name="meta"></a><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-NATO-strap-2.jpg?v=1654871843" alt="Tudor Black Bay NATO strap"></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Elements from Tudor's decades-long dive-watch history can also still be found in the bracelets and straps of the Black Bay, which are anything but off-the-rack. The design of the steel bracelets comes directly from those used on Tudor watches produced in the 1950s and 1960s, notable for the visible rivet heads on the side of the bracelet for attaching the links, and for a distinctive, stepped construction. The NATO-style fabric straps (above), </span></span>woven on 19th century looms by Tudor’s longtime partner, 150-year-old French family-owned Julien Faure, take their historical cues from a now-famous makeshift strap made during wartime by a French naval officer from a discarded parachute. </p><h3>THE COLLECTION</h3><h4>Black Bay</h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/black_bay_pro.jpg?v=1655145830" alt=""></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core Black Bay family directly descended from the original Heritage models is sized at 41mm, in the classic diver’s configuration, with cases predominantly in steel and dive-scale bezel inserts made of anodized aluminum. Nowadays, these Black Bay 41mm models contain the above-mentioned Tudor Caliber MT5602, which replaces the ETA calibers used in the very first ones. Most of the dials are matte black, with some notable exceptions, including the champagne-colored dials of the S&amp;G (Steel and Gold) bi-material models, which dresses up a steel case with a crown and bezel made of yellow gold; the models on bracelets also feature yellow gold center links. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,575 - $5,400, Case Size: 41mm, Case Thickness: 14.8mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5602</span></i></p><h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i>Black Bay Bronze</h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Bronze-Bucherer-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715088334" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div class="embed-container">In 2016, Tudor introduced a version of the Black Bay in a case made of bronze, an increasingly popular material in modern watchmaking, which has been used historically in maritime equipment such as diver’s helmets and ships’ propellers. Bronze watches are prized by some collectors for the material’s propensity to gain a patina over the years that makes each watch unique to its owner and his or her experiences. At 43mm in diameter, the Black Bay Bronze is the largest option in the Tudor Black Bay catalog, and is also the only Black Bay to use Arabic numerals at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. The brown aluminum bezel inserts harmonize with the brushed bronze case and slate-gray dial for an understated look. </div><div><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $4,250, Case Size: 43mm, Case Thickness: 14.5mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5601</span></i></div><h4><strong>Black Bay Ceramic</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Ceramic-2_1c52bb85-4e8d-4037-9f77-8965febc3be3_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715088797" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p>Unveiled to great fanfare in 2021, the most recent iteration of the Black Bay in ceramic (following up previous editions starting in 2015) riveted the watch world’s attention not only with its all-black “stealth” design — matte-black, micro-blasted, monobloc ceramic case, black-PVD-steel bezel with engraved ceramic dive-scale insert, domed black dial — but also with its movement. The automatic Tudor Caliber MT5602-1U boasted not only the COSC chronometer certificate that all Tudor calibers carry but also a Master Chronometer certificate from METAS, the Swiss Institute of Metrology, which measures not only precision but other factors like resistance to magnetic fields. Outside of Omega, which instituted the Master Chronometer tests for its own watches in 2015, Tudor is the only watch brand to earn this certification. The Black Bay Ceramic also earned Tudor another GPHG award the year of its release. </p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $4,825, Case Size: 41mm, Case Thickness: 14.4mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5602-1U</span></i></p><h4><b>Black Bay Monochrome</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Monochrome-front-2_091daf59-ed6c-44b9-b74f-fb8cd3ec0a30_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714139825"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduced at Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva in 2024, the “Monochrome” edition of the 41mm Black Bay is a sober yet oh-so-sleek iteration of the vintage-inspired sport watch, matching a matte black dial with an anodized aluminum dive-scale bezel in the same hue. Silver-toned indexes and hands, both in the recognizable Black Bay style, provide a sharp and legible contrast. Enthusiasts will also appreciate the smaller details, like the engraved Tudor rose emblem that now appears on the screw-down crown. The most important upgrade occurs on the inside: Tudor has outfitted the model with a new, proprietary movement, the automatic “Master Chronometer” Caliber MT5602-U, equipped with a silicon hairspring that helps deliver the watch a power reserve of 70 hours. Tudor offers the Monochrome edition on either a three-link or five-link steel bracelet as well as a black rubber strap.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $4,225 - $4,550, Case Size: 41mm, Case Thickness: 13.6mm, Lug Width: 21mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5602-U</span></i></p><h4>Black Bay 41/39/36/32/31 </h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-36-blue-2.jpg?v=1694612625" alt="Tudor Black Bay 36 Blue Dial"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notable for their smooth, stationary bezels — which replace the functional, rotating bezels of the “classic” Black Bay — the smaller line extensions of the core collection, in 41mm, 39mm, 36mm, 32mm, and 31mm case sizes — take the Black Bay out of its usual milieu as a stylish tool watch for divers and place it firmly within the “everyday” sports watch category. Those seeking a Black Bay model suitable for a dressier occasion can also choose from an expanding array of bi-metal S&amp;G options in each size, with yellow-gold bezels, crowns, and links <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/luxury-watch-brands" data-sanitized-target="_blank">adding a layer of luxury </a>to predominantly steel cases and bracelets. Four new steel models of the Black Bay 36, all connected to five-link steel bracelets, made their debut at Watches &amp; Wonders 2023, each hosting one of three new vibrant dial colors: blue, anthracite, and champagne. Some are also available with diamond-setting. Demonstrating how far Tudor has come since it re-entered the U.S. market in 2013, all of these watches are now fitted with in-house, automatic Tudor movements, all COSC-certified and boasting antimagnetic silicon balance springs: </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,725 - $3,050, Case Size: 32-41mm, Case Thickness: Up to 10.5mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 150 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5201</span></i></p><h4>Black Bay Fifty-Eight</h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-18K-2_ec61d3d8-0b39-485b-8ecc-ad0e037bb6b3_2048x2048.jpg?v=1715088903" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boasting both the original divers’ bezel of the 41mm model and a more modest case diameter of 39mm, the Black Bay Fifty-Eight collection hits the sweet spot for many contemporary connoisseurs. Named for the year 1958, in which Tudor released the Oyster Prince Submariner Ref. 7924, the most clear forerunner to the Black Bay, the Fifty-Eight sub-family contains the automatic, COSC-certified Caliber MT5402, a slightly downsized version of the MT5602 caliber, and has played host to a number of bold experiments in the areas of color and case materials. The Fifty-Eight Bronze combines a brown gradient dial and brown aluminum bezel insert with a bronze case and a (very rare) bronze bracelet whose newly designed “T-Fit” clasp allows for easy adjustment to five different positions on the wrist. The Fifty-Eight 18K and Fifty-Eight 925, released in 2021, are the first all-precious-metal iterations of the Black Bay, the former in a case of 18k yellow gold (above), the latter (below) in a case of 925 silver — which is even rarer than a bronze bracelet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-925-2.jpg?v=1654800173" alt="Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight 925"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Bay 18K pairs its golden case with a dark green dial and matching dark green aluminum bezel insert with a gilded dive scale; the Black Bay 925 uses a matte taupe color for its dial and bezel insert. The gold watch comes on a brown alligator strap while the silver model is mounted on either alligator leather or a fabric NATO, each taupe-colored to match the dial.

The resulting Caliber MT5813, which uses Breitling’s self-winding B01 movement as a base, features an integrated chronograph powered by a column wheel, a 70-hour power reserve and a COSC chronometer certification. The bezel on the 41mm steel case does not rotate and its anodized aluminum bezel insert is inscribed with a tachymeter scale rather than a dive-time scale, bringing this model more into the realm of motorsport than marine exploration, though the screw-down crown and chrono pushers help ensure the same 200-meter water resistance as the diving models. The dials feature contrasting subdial counters at 3 and 9 o’clock in the classical and enduringly popular “panda” style, as well as a date window at 6 o’clock. The steel-and-yellow-gold S&amp;G models host champagne-colored dials with black subdials.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Price: $5,000 - $7,200, Case Size: 41mm, Case Thickness: 14.79mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5813</i></span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Chrono-Pink-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714141476"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, Tudor stunned watch fandom with the release of a Black Bay Chrono in its boldest colorway yet: the so-called “Black Bay Chrono Pink” (above) features a domed, bright pink main dial with black subdials and a black, anodized aluminum tachymeter-scale bezel. Conceived with Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou, known for his pink attire, and style icon and fellow Tudor brand ambassador David Beckham, who chose the color for his CF Inter Miami soccer team, this “pink panda” in a 41mm steel case and five-link bracelet, outfitted with automatic Caliber MT5813, will be made in limited quantities but has already found a substantial audience of fans.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $5,000 - $7,200, Case Size: 41mm, Case Thickness: 14.79mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5813</span></i></p><h4>Black Bay GMT</h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-GMT-2_d025905f-223a-4064-8e59-badecab77d91.jpg?v=1654800334" alt="Tudor Black Bay GMT">After the <a href="https://www.tudorwatch.com/en/watches/black-bay-chrono/m79360n-0002" data-sanitized-target="_blank">Black Bay Chronograph</a> launched in 2017, Tudor’s growing legions of fans were undoubtedly wondering what the brand would do for an encore, complication-wise, in the Black Bay series. The answer came the following year, as Tudor, now firmly established as a collectible brand in its own right, pivoted back to an iconic Rolex model for inspiration. While the Black Bay GMT owes an obvious aesthetic debt to Rolex’s GMT-Master, it also fits firmly within the design language of the Black Bay, with its familiar dial framed not by a dive scale or tachymeter scale but by a bicolor 24-hour ring on which the wearer can read a second time zone thanks to the dial’s additional red GMT hand. The famous bright red-and-blue “Pepsi” bezel of Rolex’s original GMT-Master is here slightly modified to a more muted indigo-and-burgundy combo. The Black Bay GMT, powered by the COSC-certified automatic Caliber MT5662, is the latest model to debut in a two-tone S&amp;G edition, which we covered in detail <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/tudor-black-bay-gmt">here.</a> A new model with a white opaline dial, covered <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/tudor-2023">here,</a> launched at Watches &amp; Wonders '23 to further expand the GMT family.</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,850 - $5,550, Case Size: 41mm, Case Thickness: 15mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5652</span></i></p><h4>Black Bay Pro</h4><p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Pro-2.jpg?v=1654800493" alt="Tudor Black Bay Pro"></b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching at <a href="https://www.watchesandwonders.com/en/geneva-2022/event" data-sanitized-target="_blank">Watches &amp; Wonders 2022</a> alongside the Black Bay GMT S&amp;G Editions was another sporty take on a travel watch within the Black Bay family, the Black Bay Pro, which differs from the more colorful GMT models in its use of a stationary, satin-finished steel bezel with engraved numerals for its 24-hour GMT scale. The movement is the same automatic MT5662 that beats inside the Black Bay GMT, but the case is a more understated 39mm and the central hand that points to a second time zone is in yellow rather than red, offering an even greater contrast with the matte black dial. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,675 - $4,000, Case Size: 39mm, Case Thickness: 14.6mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5652</span></i></p><h4><b>Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Four</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Fifty-Four-2_4cece52e-694a-4e99-9953-f9199b11fb70.jpg?v=1694613330" alt="Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Four"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, Tudor finally resurrected the original 37mm sizing of the granddaddy of all Black Bay models, the original Oyster Prince Ref. 7922 from 1954, in a new model called — you guessed it — the Black Bay Fifty-Four. At just 11.24mm thick in stainless steel, and topped with a unidirectional bezel sans hash marks — a nod to the early days of SCUBA diving and early watches for divers — Tudor calls it “the purest modern expression of the brand’s first-ever dive watch.” Inside the 200-meter water resistant case beats the automatic Tudor Caliber MT5400, with a COSC chronometer certification and a 70-hour power reserve. Both versions of the watch — on either a riveted bracelet or a rubber strap, feature the “T-Fit” adjustment mechanism.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,700 - $3,900, Case Size: 37mm, Case Thickness: 11.24mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5400</span></i></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p><style>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The history of the watch industry is rife with groundbreaking technological developments that came about through necessity. Dive watches’ unidirectional rotating bezels were developed to save the lives of scuba divers by ensuring they wouldn’t misread their time underwater and inadvertently run out of oxygen. <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watch-lume">Luminous paint</a> on watch dials was invented so wearers could read the time in the dark or underwater. <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watches-for-engineers">Antimagnetic innovations</a> in watch movements came about as everyday life in the 20th century exposed us to more and more electromagnetic fields that affected our watches’ efficient running. One of the more recent examples is Citizen’s now-famous and still-exclusive Eco-Drive movement — which emerged as a direct result of the worldwide energy crisis that galvanized environmentalists in the 1970s.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Pocket-Watch-1924-2_bb7e0b9a-0586-487f-b1e3-d71f2cedfe6c_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714750949"></div><p><em><strong>Citizen pocket watch from 1924</strong></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizen, like all watch companies that trace their history back to the early 20th Century, was a traditional watchmaker long before it became an innovator in high-tech, electronic timekeeping — founded in 1918 in Japan, as the Shokosha Watch Research Institute. The name “Citizen” first appeared on one of the company’s pocket watches in 1924, an indication that Shokosha, which officially became Citizen Watch Company in 1930, would be devoted to making timepieces that were accessible to “all citizens” of Japan, and eventually, of the world. By the 1970s — with several milestones under its belt, including the first calendar watch and first waterproof watch made in Japan — Citizen had become one of the first fully automated watch companies and, like many of its competitors at the time, was fully engaged in the pursuit of making watches to appeal to a new generation of customers — watches with battery-powered movements, rather than mechanical ones, that would be both inexpensive to produce and far more accurate than what had come before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quest had begun as early as 1957, when American watchmaker Hamilton produced the first electronic watch,</span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/hamilton-ventura-elvis"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Ventura,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and continued into the 1960s, with another U.S.A.-based watchmaker, Bulova, adding its own milestone invention, the tuning-fork-driven </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/accutron"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accutron.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The only technology that proved to have staying power, however, was the one that debuted in 1969’s Quartz Astron, made by Citizen’s Japanese rival, Seiko — a battery-powered movement that used an electrically charged, fast-vibrating quartz crystal rather than a traditional gear train to drive the hands of the watch, for a never-before-seen accuracy of -5/+5 seconds per month. Quartz movements became the dominant technology in watchmaking for the next decade and more, and remain popular today for the same reasons they very nearly swept away their old-school mechanical counterparts back in the 1970s and ‘80s: quartz-powered watches are more accurate, more shock-resistant, and more affordable than mechanical ones. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/1970s-Gas-Shortage-Line-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714743486" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><em><strong>Gasoline shortages led to long lines in the 1970s Energy Crisis.</strong></em></p><p>One issue with quartz calibers remained vexing, however (other than their being looked down upon by mechanical-watch purists) — the fact that they needed regular battery changes to keep working in the long term and thus, generated chemical waste when those spent batteries ended up in landfills. Fuel shortages and skyrocketing energy prices in the 1970s, prompted by an international embargo on petroleum products by the Arab oil exporting countries of OPEC, was also a factor, as it not only led to the infamous gas-station lines pictured above, but also forced a renewed interest in non-fossil fuel energy sources such as solar power. Citizen, which made its first quartz watch in 1973, set out to solve the problem with some clever innovating of its own that centered around harnessing the power of sunlight.</p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Crystron-Watch-1976-2_b6a70ecc-ad79-4616-ba96-362e3e2a764a_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714679414"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The origin of Eco-Drive, Citizen’s most influential and well-known technical contribution to watch history, begins in 1976, with the introduction of the Quartz Crystron Solar Cell (above), the first watch with a quartz movement whose rechargeable battery was under a photovoltaic solar panel that could absorb energy from any light source — from natural sunlight to a lamp on a nightstand. This so-called “Sunwatch,” which was notable for its grid of four solar cells extending radially from the center, was the first light-powered analog wristwatch, but its battery life was very low — it generally needed recharging once a week — so Citizen continued upgrading the light-charging technology. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1986, upon successfully developing thinner solar cells to generate energy and stronger batteries to store it, Citizen released another “solar cell” watch that could run on a single charge of light for eight days, or 200 hours. The next step in the technology’s evolution was in 1995, when Citizen added a lithium-ion power cell that extended the watch’s running time to six full months on a single charge.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Eco-Drive-2_6d3d95ab-bd7b-46a1-b2ce-6036a0b633ce_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714679487"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Citizen Eco-Drive watches, powered by the Caliber 7878, were launched one year after this breakthrough, in 1996. They were equipped with the groundbreaking technology that is still at the heart of the Eco-Drive movements today: light passes through a translucent dial with an amorphous silicon photocell mounted directly underneath it, which supplies power to the lithium ion battery of the movement below. From an environmental standpoint, this also means the wearer almost never needs to discard old batteries and replace them with new ones. The first generation of Eco-Drive watches were simple three-hand timekeepers with dates, but as the technology improved, future iterations included a wide range of complications and styles, including chronographs, perpetual calendars, analog-digital displays and, beginning in 1998 with the Promaster Eco-Duo Drive, dive watches.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Promaster-Dive-Orca-2_9239278c-11f3-4245-82cf-b00c4541f7ee_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714680016"></div><p><em><strong>Many Citizen dive watches, like the Promaster Diver "Orca" still use Eco-Drive calibers.</strong></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the late 1990s, Citizen experimented with other variations on the Eco-Drive system, as in the Eco-Drive Thermo watches that surfaced in 1999, which used the “Thermo electricity” generated by the temperature difference between the wearer’s arm and his surroundings, to power the movement. Another version, which was used in the aforementioned Promaster dive watch, was the Hybrid Eco-Drive movement that used both mechanical parts and a solar cell to charge the watch’s functions. Both of these offshoots have since been discontinued, and the core light-powered Citizen Eco-Drive movement has become the tentpole technology around which Citizen has built much of its modern collection — even as Citizen has continued to improve upon it. By the early 2000s, for example, the company developed smaller, ring-shaped solar cells that eliminated the need for transparent dial materials and opened up new design possibilities for the dials (see below).</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Eco-Drive-ring-solar-cell-diagram-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714748585" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 21st century, Citizen has taken its emblematic light-powered technology to new levels of precision, first with the integration of radio-controlled timing technology into its Eco-Drive calibers in 2002. Introduced into watchmaking by the German brand </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/junghans-max-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Junghans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1990, and first used by Citizen in a watch as early as 1993, radio-controlled timekeeping works by regularly synching a watch’s electronic movement with a transmitter from one of the world’s ultra-precise atomic clocks, ensuring a precision of just one second’s error per 100,000 years. In theory, radio-controlled Eco-Drive watches will never need battery changes or manual resetting — just regular exposure to sunlight and atmospheric radio waves. </span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Eco-Drive-Proximity-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714678210"></div><p><em><strong>Citizen ventured into smartwatch territory with the Eco-Drive Proximity in 2012.</strong></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, Citizen launched the first Eco-Drive GPS Satellite Wave watches, which received time synchronization signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to automatically update their time and date anywhere in the world. One year later, in 2012, came the Citizen Eco-Drive Proximity, what we would today call a Smartwatch, which connected to an Apple iPhone for an array of functions, including alerts for incoming calls, texts, and email messages.  </span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Eco-Drive-One-2_1731b2ab-9f20-479e-b18a-69a8a464e9c4_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714677889"></div><p>Eco-Drive turned 40 years old in 2016, and Citizen marked the anniversary with the launch of a new watch called Eco-Drive One (above), which at the time of its release was the thinnest light-powered analog watch in the world. Its case, made of a ceramic composite material called cermet, is 38.15mm in diameter and just 2.98 mm thick, with a bezel made of cemented carbide, a material boasting extreme hardness as well as high corrosion- and oxidation-resistance. Its Eco-Drive movement, which Citizen says required a total redesign of the original, comes in at just 1.00 mm thick and still claims an accuracy of +/-15 seconds per month. The movement also consumed less energy than its thicker predecessors, enabling the watch to run for 10 months on a single full charge from any light source. </p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Citizen-Eco-Drive-Calibr-0100-2_72d024c2-9447-4c07-9670-79773e80be9f_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714679245"></div><p><em><strong>Citizen's Caliber 0100 is the most accurate Eco-Drive movement ever made.</strong></em></p><p>The most significant advance came in 2019, with the introduction of Caliber 0100, an Eco-Drive movement that calibrates time to an astonishing accuracy of +/- 1 second per year. The watch that contains it is the current record holder for the title of “world’s most accurate watch.”  Caliber 0100 achieves this unprecedented feat without relying on synchronized data from satellites or radio-controlled clocks. Instead, Citizen equipped the caliber with new AT-cut-type crystal oscillators, which vibrate at a frequency of 8.4 MHz, in place of the tuning fork-shaped oscillators used in most quartz movements. The former’s frequency is more than 250 times higher than the latter’s. Citizen also devised clever power-saving strategies for the movement while also ensuring the entire mechanism is resistant to outside influences such as temperature variations, gravity, and age degradation. The result is dependably stable operation for up to six months on a single light charge, or eight months in its power-save mode. The watch will even automatically correct the hand positions after it is subjected to shocks. As the move toward sustainable energy sources continues to accelerate around the world, Citizen Eco-Drive watches remain on the cutting edge of technology.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 1839 in Geneva, Patek Philippe has long been the gold standard of high watchmaking, pioneering complications and design elements that are now found widely throughout the watch industry — from the first keyless winding system in 1845 to the first annual calendar wristwatch in 1996, with many other innovations and historic timepieces in between. Throughout the <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maison’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long and prestigious history, watches from Patek Philippe have proven to be among the most coveted and valuable on the watch-auction circuit, making up nine of the 10 most expensive watches ever sold and 14 of the top 20. What are these record-breaking Patek Philippe timepieces, what makes them so special, and exactly how much money did they fetch when the hammer came down? Below, we count down the top 10, ending with the most expensive watch ever sold at auction.</span></span></p><h4><b>Patek Philippe Gold Chronograph Ref. 1527 ($5.709 million, 2010, Christie’s)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-gold-1527_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589246" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sold at Christie’s in 2010 and still holding its spot in the top 10 most expensive Patek Philippe watches, this exceedingly rare perpetual calendar chronograph with a yellow-gold tonneau case more than doubled its pre-auction estimate. Its matte silver dial features applied Arabic numerals, a tachymeter scale, and three subdials for chronograph minutes, running seconds, date, and moon-phases. Its movement is stamped with the prestigious Geneva Seal, attesting to its elite level of finishing as well as its chronometric performance.</span></p><h4><b>9. Patek Philippe Titanium Ref. 5208T-010 ($6.226 million, 2017, Christie’s)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Titanium-OW-2_679b0032-ddf3-4a05-9f2e-bcb99e7b3f8b_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589311" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding the record for second-highest price fetched at the biennial Only Watch charity auction, this one-of-a-kind timepiece is the first and only model of the Ref. 5208 “Triple Complication” to be made with a titanium case. The watch’s three complications, powered by the R CH 27 PS QI movement, include a minute repeater, a monopusher chronograph, and an instantaneous perpetual calendar. Patek also went above and beyond the call for the movement decoration in this piece, adding a black rhodium finish on the bridges and a guilloché treatment on the platinum rotor.</span></p><h4><b>8. Patek Philippe Nautilus Ref. 5711/1A-018 </b><b><i>“</i></b><b>Tiffany &amp; Co.” ($6.5 million, 2021, Phillips)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Nautilus-Tiffsny-2_3b32d9af-152a-411d-b6de-d85ddc574159_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589357" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patek Philippe announced it was discontinuing its megapopular Nautilus model (Ref. 5711) in 2021, kicking off a frenzied panic among that watch’s wannabe owners and in effect making the existing examples of it even more unobtainable than before. Somewhat unexpectedly, however, Patek gave the Nautilus a memorable curtain call later that year, producing a limited run of models that would be retailed exclusively through Tiffany &amp; Co., the watchmaker’s longtime U.S. retail partner, and bore an eye-catching Tiffany Blue dial. Out of the 170 pieces, all inscribed with a special 170th anniversary inscription on the caseback and quickly snapped up by Patek’s most devoted, connected, and deep-pocketed patrons, one single piece was put up for auction in December 2021 and acquired for $6.5 million by longtime Patek collector Zach Lu. Proceeds from the sale at Phillips’ New York HQ went to the Nature Conservancy.</span></p><h4><b>7. Patek Philippe Stainless Steel Ref. 5016A-010 ($7.259 million, 2015, Phillips)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-steel-OW-2_5b79c02b-5e26-42f3-b40c-c17dc0ed479b_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589429" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling for more than $7 million at the Only Watch Geneva in 2015, this steel-cased Patek Philippe combines three elite horological complications: a minute repeater, a tourbillon, and a perpetual calendar with moon-phase. Driven by a 506-part manually wound movement, the watch also features a retrograde date hand that flies back to the beginning of the next month after every 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. Mounted on a dark blue alligator strap, this watch is also desirable for its understated size — just under 37mm in diameter despite its ultra-complex inner mechanism.</span></p><h4><b>6. Patek Philippe Two Crown Worldtime Ref. 2523 “Eurasia” ($7.682 million, 2021, Phillips)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Two-Crown-Eurasia-2_2223ee5a-140c-4c73-8fab-91d43d11ac49_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589621" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This watch sold for $7.8 million in Geneva in 2021, setting the record price for a watch with a “Heures Universelle” world-time function and simultaneously becoming the highest-selling watch ever in a yellow-gold case. Nicknamed “The Silk Road,” this reference is noteworthy for its cloisonné dial depicting the supercontinent of Eurasia.</span></p><h4><b>5. Patek Philippe Gobbi Milan "Heures Universelles" Ref. 2523 ($8.967 million, 2019, Christie’s)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Gobbi-Milan-2_109e6448-89d3-4b31-bd89-ecadb9ca5dfe_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589676" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating back to 1953, this extremely rare Patek (another world-timer, of which only seven pieces were made) went on the block at Christie’s in Hong Kong in 2019 and became, as of this writing, the most expensive watch ever auctioned in Asia. Endowed with the “Heures Universelle” function designed by legendary watchmaker Louis Cottier, it has a rose-gold case and blue enamel dial and it’s the only known example of this reference to bear the signature of both Patek Philippe and the prestigious Milan retailer Gobbi. Its silvered outer ring hosts the engraved, enameled names of 40 world cities and encircles a two-tone 24-hour ring divided into gray (nighttime) and white (daytime).</span></p><h4><b>4. Patek Philippe “Prince Mohammed Tewfik A. Toussou” Ref. 1518 ($9,570 million, 2021, Sotheby’s)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Tewlik-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589754" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This timepiece, in a 35mm rose gold case, with perpetual calendar and chronograph functions, has a noteworthy provenance: it belonged to Prince Mohammed Tewfik A. Toussou of Egypt. The Prince, who acquired the watch in 1951, was a direct descendant of Muhammad Ali, the founder of modern Egypt. The watch was believed to be one of only about 340 pieces that Patek made, and released in 1941. This version, with its copper-pink dial, is even rarer, with only 14 known to exist. The Prince’s heirs consigned it to Sotheby’s in 2021 after his death in April of that year, and it sold for more than $9.5 million at a December 2021 auction in New York.</span></p><h4><b>3. Patek Philippe Stainless Steel Ref. 1518 ($11.137 million, 2016, Phillips)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Ref-1518-2_959be0a2-0f2f-4560-88cc-8824e21f625f_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589873" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This perpetual calendar chronograph from Patek Philippe briefly held the title for most expensive watch sold at auction when it went for 9.6 million Swiss francs at a Phillips Auction in Geneva in 2016. Dating to 1941, it is significant in several respects: the reference is the first wristwatch with both a perpetual calendar and chronograph, and it is one of only four total models made in steel — a complicated watch of any kind being an extreme rarity during the World War II years, when most steel was earmarked for the war effort. The 35mm case houses an extensively modified Valjoux caliber with exquisite Patek Philippe finishing.</span></p><h4><b>2. Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication Ref. 198.385 ($24 million, 2014, Sotheby’s)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe_Graves-Supercomplication-2_47d81110-5772-4535-a3d7-49c5ae50fb45_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589926" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Graves, Jr., was a New York banker and avid watch collector who, legend has it, was engaged in a competition with fellow tycoon James Ward Packard (of Packard Motors) to become the owner of the world’s most complicated watch. In 1933, the timepiece that Graves commissioned from Patek Philippe, aptly named the Henry Graves Supercomplication, earned that distinction with its 24 complications, blowing away the 10 complications of the watch Patek had made for Packard in 1927. The array of horological functions built into the unique, gold pocket watch include Westminster chimes, perpetual calendar, sunrise and sunset times, and a celestial map of New York as seen from Graves's Fifth Avenue apartment. After Graves died in 1953, the watch changed hands several times throughout the years, and was auctioned for the first time by Sotheby’s in 1999, bought for a then-record price of $11,002,500 by Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al Thani of the Qatar Royal Family. After his death, the watch was auctioned again by Sotheby’s in 2014, sold to an anonymous buyer and breaking another record.</span></p><h4><b>Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010 ($31.19 million, 2019, Christie’s)</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Grandmaster-Chime-2_03c28e5d-d306-4eb2-ad73-e67c758c68fe_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714589985" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/patek-philippe-calatrava?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_expensive-watches">Patek Philippe</a> unveiled the first Grandmaster Chime watch in 2014 as part of the many celebrations around the Genevan <i>maison’s</i> 175the anniversary. The reference that made history at the Only Watch auction in Geneva in 2019 was a unique piece, the only Grandmaster Chime ever crafted in stainless steel; the Grandmaster Chime models in Patek’s regular collection are all made in precious metals. The watch is the most complicated Patek Philippe wristwatch ever made (distinguishing it from the maker’s most complicated pocket watch, as detailed above), with 20 complications, displayed on two dials, one ebony black, the other salmon, for each side of the swiveling, reversible case with its elaborate hobnail guilloché-patterned sides. Among the cornucopia of complications are two patented world-premieres —  an acoustic alarm that chimes at a pre-programmed time and a date repeater that can strike the date on demand — along with a Grande and Petite Sonnerie, moon-phases, and a perpetual calendar. In the tradition of the biennial Only Watch auction, proceeds from the staggering, record-breaking hammer price of $31 million went toward research into a cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.</span></p><p></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Cartier Tank is one of the most influential and recognizable luxury watches in the world, as well as being one of the few truly iconic timepieces whose appeal is truly unisex: Cartier Tank watches are beloved by both men and women and worn in a diverse array of sizes, colorways, and variations on the original watch’s classical shape and dimensions. Throughout its prestigious history, the Cartier Tank has evolved in ways that are both subtle and revolutionary and has appeared in forms of which many of us might not even be aware. Here is a guide to the modern Cartier Tank collection and a bit of background on each model.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Louis-Francois-Cartier-portrait-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714503762"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">While it is today better known as one of the world’s leading jewelers, Cartier’s roots are in the art of horology. Its eponymous founder, Louis-Francois Cartier </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">(above,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> 1819-1904), was an apprentice to master watchmaker Adolphe Piccard before founding his own company, at the age of 28, in Piccard’s Parisian workshop in 1847. Several generations of family ownership would follow, and Cartier’s watches, and eventually its jewelry, cultivated a worldwide audience and an esteemed client list that included aristocrats and crowned heads; Britain’s King Edward VII famously dubbed Cartier “the jeweller of kings and the king of jewellers.” </span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Renault-FT-17-tank-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714503544"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">In the early 20th century, during the third generation of family ownership, Cartier produced some of its most epochal timepieces under the creative direction of Louis Cartier, grandson of Louis-Francois, who ran the business with his brothers Jacques and Pierre. The first of these iconic watches was the Santos in 1904, made under special instructions for Louis Cartier’s fellow Parisian A-lister, the pioneering aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, and today regarded as the first men’s wristwatch. The second came along in 1917, and owed its unique appearance to a military conveyance (above) used by France during the first World War.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Louis-Cartier-2_2f930b24-1143-4538-a717-3d47a3feba79_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714492188"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis Cartier’s first Tank watch, which didn’t actually go into serial production until 1919, derived its name and its rectangular, curvilinear case shape from the Renault FT-17 tank, designed by France’s Renault automobile company, whose fully rotating turret of armaments made it one of the most influential tank designs in history. The Tank took some cues from its predecessor, the Santos, but the clean lines and gently sloping profile of its case, which integrated harmoniously into its leather strap, gave it an elegant personality of its own, one that appealed to a wide range of customers, both male and female, in the dawning age of the wristwatch and well into the 20th Century. With its dial’s rectangular ring of Roman hour numerals, interior railroad minute track, blued sword hands, and  beaded crown with blue sapphire cabochon, it  was also one of the first and most enduring examples of the influence of Art Deco, which thrived in the U.S. and Europe throughout the 1920s and into the ‘30s, on wristwatch design. Choosing a rectangle, rather than a more traditional round shape, for the case, was also a bold statement that the Tank was a true original, designed to be worn on the wrist, as opposed to other early wristwatches at the time, which were essentially round pocket watches repurposed for wrist wear. </span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Jackie-Kennedy-watch-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714493150"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps fittingly, the recipient of the first prototype Cartier Tank watch was U.S. General John “Black Jack” Pershing, commander of the Allied forces, which included France, in World War I. After the Tank exploded in popularity in the 1920s, it became ubiquitous on the silver screen and in the halls of power and influence. Rudolph Valentino wore the watch for his final role, in the 1926 film <i>The Son of the Sheik, </i>supposedly on the actor’s own insistence. U.S. first lady Jacqueline Kennedy was famously photographed wearing a Tank, a gift from her brother-in-law, starting in 1963; that watch (above) fetched $379,500 at auction in 20017, becoming the most expensive Cartier Tank ever sold. Pop Art icon and provocateur Andy Warhol was a fan of the model, calling it “the watch to wear,” and sported one on many occasions, although he claimed he never actually wound it or used it to tell time. Cartier has embraced the Tank watch as its flagship timepiece collection for both men and ladies, and here in the 21st Century continues to find new and interesting variations on the 1917 classic, some of them drawn from the model’s century-plus history on the market. Here is a rundown of the modern Tank collection, which arguably offers a size, style, and aesthetic execution for just about anyone.</span></p><h4><b>TANK FRANÇAISE</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Francaise-2_194c7180-b423-4914-9bd0-c838d4c24a56_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714491426"></div><p></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,700  - $32,800, Case size: 25.7mm x 21.2mm (Small), 32mm x 27mm (Medium), 36.7mm x 30.5mm (Large); Thickness: 6.8mm (Small), 7.1mm (Medium), 10.1mm (Large), Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Quartz (Small and Medium), Automatic Caliber MC 1853 (Large)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduced in 1996 but carrying on the spirit of some of the earliest Tank models from the 1920s, the Tank Française is distinguished by the more rectangular aspect ratio of its case compared to the squarish shape of the original Tank, its more angled and pointed lugs that extend from the brancards, and its integrated bracelet with similarly angled, pointed links. It was the first watch in the long-tenured Tank collection specifically designed to be mounted on a metal bracelet. The feminine version of “French” in the model’s name indicates that it’s mostly aimed at a female customer; the “Large” version of the watch, housing Cartier automatic Caliber MC 1853 (based on the Sellita SW 100), is a relatively modest 36.7mm by 30.5mm. The “Small” and “Medium” versions of the Tank Francaise range from 25.7mm to 32mm and contain quartz movements.</span></p><h4><b>TANK AMÉRICAINE</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Americaine-2_b8848411-01b6-4af8-8240-24668b2b25cb_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714491683"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,400  - $53,500, Case size: 28mm x 15.2mm (Mini), 35.4mm x 19.4mm (Small), 44.4mm x 24.4mm (Large); Thickness: 6.5mm (Mini), 6.8mm (Small), 8.6mm (Large), Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Quartz (Mini and Small), Automatic Caliber MC 1899 (Large)</span></i></p><p>The Tank Américaine debuted in 1989, taking its distinctive, elongated case shape, with an almost-flat back and a curving, domed front, from the early Tank Cintrée models, which were first seen in 1919, just a few years after the first Tank debuted. The first Tank Américaine models were in gold cases and contained quartz movements; in 2017, the centennial of the first Tank Watch, Cartier released the first Tank Américaine in steel. Echoing the dials of the Cintrée watches, the Tank Américaine dials feature a minute track that curves at the top and bottom; surrounded by radiating Roman numerals and blued steel sword hands — only two of them, for the hour and minute, with no seconds hand —  along with a vertical brushed (on the Large) or sunray (on the Small and Mini) surface finish. The octagonal crown is topped with a blue spinel. Truly a unisex product family, Tank Americaine watches range from “Mini” to “Small” (both powered by quartz movements) to the “Large” model, housing the automatic mechanical Caliber 1899 MC, introduced in 2023 specifically for this watch.</p><h4><b>TANK LOUIS CARTIER</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Must-2_ca56bbc4-8ae2-466e-a689-e59885f8b38f_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714492282"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $10,200  - $24,800, Case size: 29.5mm x 22mm (Small), 33.7mm x 25.5mm (Large); Thickness: 6.8mm (Small, Large), 6.6mm (Large), Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Quartz, (Small), Hand-wound mechanical Caliber 1917 MC 1853 (Small, Large)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model that was the most direct ancestor to the Tank Louis Cartier debuted in 1922. It took the rectangular case of the original 1917 model (now known as the “Tank Normale,” the  one most directly influenced by the Renault Ft-17) and softened it with more rounded outer edges, more scalloping, and a slightly elongated dial that more elegantly integrated into the case dimensions — as opposed to the "Tank Normale," which had a square dial inside a rectangle case. This is the groundbreaking version of the Tank watch that has provided the DNA for so many Art Deco-inspired dress watches today, and the reason so many of them are referred to in shorthand as “Tank-style.” The contemporary Tank Louis Cartier is indisputably a luxury dress watch, with the highest starting price point of the Tank sub-families, executed in precious metal cases — mostly rose gold and yellow gold — and mounted on alligator leather straps. In addition to the classical dials with Roman numerals and rectangular railroad minute tracks, the collection also offers simple, sober, lacquer-effect two-handed dials (as above) with no numerals or markers. Sizes range from Small to Large, with each size offering a hand-wound mechanical movement, in addition to quartz movements in the Small models.</span></p><h4><b>TANK MUST</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"></div><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Must-Solarbeat-watches-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714500811" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,300  - $6,850, Case size: 29.5mm x 22mm (Small), 33.7mm x 25.5mm (Large); 41mm x 31mm (Extra Large); Thickness: 6.6mm (Small, Large), 8.4mm (Extra Large); Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: SolarBeat photovoltaic (Small), quartz and high-autonomy quartz (Small, Large), Automatic Caliber 1847 MC 1853 (Extra Large)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tank Must is considered the “entry level” Tank and derives its name and styling from a series of affordably priced Tank models that Cartier released in the 1970s, which were remembered for their gold-plated (rather than gold) cases, quartz movements, colorful lacquered dials with a minimalist aesthetic — i.e., just a simple pair of sword hands for the hour and minute, sans Roman numeral markers or the rectangular <i>chemin-de-fer</i> minute track. Several of the modern Tank Must pieces carry on that tradition today: the Small models, at 29.5mm by 22mm, contain quartz movements and are mounted on shiny leather straps color-coordinated with the dials. The Large watches, with a more traditional Tank dial, are 33.7mm by 25.5mm and also equipped with a quartz caliber. Only the Extra-Large (41mm x 31mm) Tank Must timepieces carry the automatic Caliber 1847 MC, and also feature the classic dial with Roman numerals, blued sword hands, and the hallmark <i>flinqué</i> guilloché pattern in the dial’s center. Tank Must models, all in steel cases, come on either a leather strap or an interchangeable steel bracelet. It was in the Tank Must collection that Cartier introduced its revolutionary “Solarbeat” quartz movement, which uses a long-life (16 years) rechargeable battery powered by light.</span></p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>CARTIER PRIVÉ COLLECTION</b></span></h4><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, Cartier launched its Cartier Privé collection, a series of limited-edition and annual-production timepieces that are essentially modern resissues of watches from the watchmaker-jeweller's vast historical archives. As one might expect, historical versions of the iconic Tank have been among the most popular of the Privé editions.</span></em></p><h4><b>TANK CINTRÉE</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Prive-Tank-Cintree-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714492862"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $20,400  - $23,500, Case size: 46.3mm x 23mm; Thickness: 7.2mm; Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Manual-winding Caliber 8971 MC</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspiration for today’s Tank Americaine got its own revival in 2018, when Cartier resurrected the Tank Cintrée within the Privé collection. The original watch, whose name literally means “curved Tank,” debuted in 1921 and was noteworthy for its very thin, very curvy dimensions. The new model, which was available in platinum, rose gold, and yellow gold, matches the dimensions of its ancestor — 46.3mm by 23mm wide by 7.2mm thick — and has a radial-brushed dial with Rococo-style numerals at 12 and 6 o’clock and thin, baton indexes at the other hour positions; the latter elements distinguish the model from the Tank Americaine, with its Roman numeral hour markers, though both models have the familiar minute track with curved top and bottom. The entire case also has a more pronounced curve than the Americaine’s, whose top is domed but whose back is flatter. Inside the Tank Cintrée, Cartier installed the mechanical Caliber 8971 MC, which is based on the tonneau-shaped Jaeger-LeCoultre Caliber 846/1 that is commonly found in that historical watchmaker’s Reverso watches.</span></p><h4><b>TANK ASYMÉTRIQUE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Asymetrique-Skeleton-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714492532"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $26,400  - $30,100, Case size: 47.15mm x 26.10mm; Thickness: 6.38mm; Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Manual winding Caliber 1917 MC</span></i></p><div style="text-align: start;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original Tank Asymétrique, with its unconventional tilted case, off-center dial, and triple lugs, appeared in 1936. Cartier unveiled its modern Privé descendant in 2020 in six different models. Three of the new editions are very evocative of the original, with solid, sunburst dials and a combination of printed indexes and vintage-style Arabic numerals marking the hours at a 30-degree angle to the right of center; the other trio are defiantly modern, with skeltonized movements that are visible through a sapphire dial and whose enlarged “12” and “6” hour numerals are sculpted from the movement’s bridges and blue-painted to match the blue cabochons on the pointed crown. All the Tank Asymétrique models are in precious metals (rose gold, yellow gold, and platinum), with case measurements of 47.15mm long by 26.10mm wide by 6.38mm thick. The movement in the solid-dial version is the in-house, manual-winding Cartier Caliber 1917 MC; the skeleton models contain Caliber 9623, also manually wound, which has been artistically openworked to put its essential parts on full display. The platinum-cased skeleton watch is further enhanced with diamonds.</span></p><h4><strong>TANK CHINOISE</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Prive-Chinoise-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714500021"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $26,400  - $30,100, Case size: 47.15mm x 26.10mm; Thickness: 6.38mm; Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 30 meters, Movement: Manual winding Caliber 1917 MC, Manual-winding skeletonized Caliber 9627 MC</span></i></p><p>Debuting in 1922, in an era when interest in Chinese and other East Asian design styles was in vogue, the Tank Chinoise was yet another variation on the classic 1917 original Tank, distinguished by the two additional brancards (aka the extended bars that flowed into the lugs on the sides) across the top and bottom of the case, which gave the model an appealing cross-hatched look evocative of Chinese porticos. For its 100th anniversary in 2022, Cartier brought the Chinoise into the Privé collection, once again in six editions, three re-creating the more traditional dial of the vintage watch, three embracing a Chinese architectural aesthetic with openworked rectilinear-pattern dials with decorative lacquer treatments. The newer Tank Chinoise models, in yellow or rose gold and platinum, are more rectangular than their square-oriented predecessors and use the hallmark Cartier sword hands rather than the Breguet-style hands on the 1922 models. Manually-winding mechanical movements tick inside all six watches, either the Caliber 1917 (as you might expect, deriving its numeral from the Tank’s birthday year; the “MC,” incidentally, is for “Manufacture Cartier”), or the skeletonized Caliber 9627 MC, both offering 38-hour power reserves.</p><h4><b>TANK NORMALE</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Tank-Normale-Skeleton-wrist-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714502772"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $31,000 - $53,000 (Tank Normale), $71,000 - $107,000 (Tank Normale Skeleton), Case size: 35.2mm x 27.8mm; Thickness: 6.85mm; Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: N/A, Movement: Manual winding Caliber 070 MC, Manual-winding skeletonized Caliber 9628 MC</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartier re-created the Tank watch that started it all for its most recent Privé collection model in 2023, the Tank Normale. Like the Chinoise and Asymetrique editions that preceded it to market, the Normale series of limited editions is comprised of period-appropriate reissues — albeit with increased dimensions of 35.2mm x 27.8mm and a new manually wound movement, the 82-piece Caliber 070 — and avant-garde, skeletonized versions, here with an interesting horological twist. The manually wound Caliber 9628 MC inside the skeleton models features a symmetrical, day-night-motif bridge structure — with the balance at 12 o’clock inside at the heart of a cutout “sun” and the barrel at 6 o’clock forming the crescent of the “moon.” The arrangement harmonizes with the watch’s unusual 24-hour time display, with a blued hour hand moving once per day over the openworked mainplate of the dial. All limited editions, the Tank Normale editions come in the typical assortment of precious metals, including one fully diamond-set platinum-cased edition.</span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tudor returned to the U.S. market after a lengthy absence in 2013 and the Rolex-owned brand had its first big hit in this modern era with the launch of the Black Bay (originally the Heritage Black Bay), a stylish, sporty divers’ watch, with a plethora of historical details drawn from Tudor dive watches of yore. In 2018, in response to growing consumer demand both for more modest case sizes and for greater period authenticity in vintage-style timepieces, Tudor introduced the Black Bay Fifty-Eight, which proved to hit the sweet spot for many contemporary enthusiasts. Named for the year 1958, in which Tudor released the Oyster Prince Submariner Ref. 7924, the most clear forerunner to the Black Bay, the Black Bay Fifty-Eight models match that watch’s 39mm case diameter, which is downsized from the 41mm-to-43mm sizes still common to the core Black Bay series. Since its launch, the Black Bay Fifty-Eight has become one of the most popular extensions of the expanding Black Bay collection, and has been the stage for Tudor’s recent (and historically rare) forays into the realm of precious metals.</span></p><h4>Descended From a Prince: Black Bay DNA</h4><p><img alt="Tudor Oyster Prince Submariner" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Oyster-Prince-Submariner-2.jpg?v=1662058183"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aesthetic origin of the Black Bay starts with the Tudor Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1954, one year after big brother Rolex rolled out its own much more famous purpose-built dive watch, also called the Submariner. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This original version, Ref. 7922, used the same “Mercedes” handset found on many Rolex models and was water-resistant to 100 meters; its successor in 1958, Ref. 7924, upped this rating to 200 meters, which is still the standard for Tudor dive watches today. Nicknamed the “Big Crown” because of its extra-large 8mm winding crown, this model underwent a series of mostly small evolutions in subsequent years, chiefly in details like the crown guards and dial verbiage, until it was replaced in 1969 by Ref. 7016,  whose newly designed, distinctive square-themed hands and markers earned it the nickname “Snowflake.” That watch remained in Tudor’s catalog until the early 1980s and provided the template for the next decade’s worth of Submariners. While each of these landmark models would lend an element of inspiration to the modern Tudor Black Bay template, it is the 1958 Oyster Prince Submariner — which established 39mm as the series’ default case size shortly after the first models were sized at 37mm — that can be identified as having the most direct lineage to the Black Bay Fifty Eight collection. Here is a breakdown of all the Black Bay Fifty-Eight models currently on the market.</span></p><h4>Basic Black: Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight Refs. M79030N-0002, M79030N-0003, M79030N-0001</h4><p><b><img alt="Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight Black" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-Black-2.jpg?v=1662059417"></b></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,475 - $3,800, Case size: 39mm, Thickness: 11.9mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor MT5402</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Black Bay Fifty-Eight watch from 2018, still a mainstay of the collection-within-the-collection, has a classical matte black dial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with all the familiar, vintage-derived Black Bay elements, including the combination of circles, rectangles, and inverted triangle at the hour points, the “snowflake” hour hand, sword minute hand and lollipop-style central seconds hand, and gilt-printed details like the inscriptions and chapter ring. The 39mm case is in brushed and polished stainless steel, with the archetypical “big crown” that screws in securely to ensure a 200-meter water resistance, and a unidirectional dive-scale bezel whose black anodized aluminum disk features gilded dive-scale markings to match the dial elements. The original 41mm Black Bay models, which were released before Tudor starting making its own movements, contained modified ETA calibers, but Tudor has equipped the Black Bay Fifty-Eight from the beginning with the in-house Caliber MT5402, a movement </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developed specifically for the Fifty-Eight series’ smaller case dimensions, with a monobloc tungsten rotor, a variable inertia balance held by a traversing bridge, an antimagnetic silicon hairspring, and a COSC chronometer certification. </span></p><h4>Navy Blue: Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight Refs. M79030B-0002, M79030B-0003, M79030B-0001</h4><p><b><img alt="Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight Navy Blue" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-Navy-Blue-2.jpg?v=1662059550"></b></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,475 - $3,800, Case size: 39mm, Thickness: 11.9mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor MT5402</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Bay being every inch a classic dive watch, and blue tones still enjoying immense popularity among watch aficionados, a version of the Black Bay Fifty-Eight with a vibrant blue dial was the inevitable follow-up to the black-dialed original. (The original Tudor Submariner’s connection to the French navy back in the 1950s was probably also a strong motivation, as well as a hint.) That watch, the Black Bay Fifty Eight Navy Blue, dropped in 2020 as one of that pandemic-plagued year’s most crowd-pleasing new releases. Its brushed-and-polished steel case, with a blue anodized aluminum bezel insert hosting silver-gilded markings for the dive scale, frames a domed, matte navy blue dial with a grained surface. The “snowflake” hands and geometrical hour markers are treated with luminous material and the screw-down crown is engraved with a Tudor rose emblem. The self-winding MT5402 Caliber ticks away inside the case, amassing a weekend-proof 70-hour power reserve. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like its black-dialed predecessor, the Fifty-Eight Navy Blue is offered on three bracelet options: a riveted steel bracelet with the same finished surfaces as the case; a blue “soft touch” flannel-style strap; and a blue-toned Jacquard fabric NATO-strap, woven on 19th century looms by the 150-year-old French family firm Julien Faure, Tudor’s strap-making partner for over 10 years. </span></p><h4>Bronze Age: Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight Bronze Ref. M79012M-0001</h4><p><b><img alt="Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight Bronze" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-Bronze-2_170c9232-1fe6-4088-8da2-c08b8e07bc8b.jpg?v=1662059841"></b></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $4,625, Case size: 39mm, Thickness: 11.9mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor MT5400</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tudor introduced bronze, a material with an on-theme history of use in maritime vessels and equipment, into the original Black Bay collection in 2017, mounting the bronze-alloy case on a brown leather strap. For the first bronze watch in the Fifty-Eight subfamily, Tudor went all-in, crafting not only a 39mm case made of bronze (contrasting with the 43mm case of the first Black Bay Bronze, the largest in the core collection) but also a rarely seen bronze bracelet. The dial, as well as the aluminum bezel insert, are executed in a warm reddish brown that harmonizes with the red-gold hue of the satin-brushed case and bracelet. The bracelet, in the three-link Oyster style characteristic of sports watches from parent brand Rolex, has been fitted with the innovative “T-fit” rapid adjustment system for the clasp, which allows the user to adjust it in five separate positions without the need for tools. The movement inside is Tudor’s Caliber MT540, which is identical in just about every respect to the MT5402 but a smidgen larger in diameter so as to better be shown off behind a sapphire display back. Finally, as fans of bronze watches know, this nearly all-bronze timepiece (the caseback is steel with bronze-colored PVD, a more skin-friendly material) will develop a unique patina over years of wear to make the watch truly one with its wearer. The watch is delivered with an additional bronze-brown NATO fabric strap. </span></p><h4>Silver Streak: Tudor Black Bay Fifty Eight 925 Refs. M79010SG-0001, M79010SG-0002</h4><p><b><img alt="Tudor Black Bay Fifty Eight 925" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-925-2_ad773163-53b7-4b9d-9bc8-a4569081b3bb.jpg?v=1662059998"></b></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $4,400 Case size: 39mm, Thickness: 11.9mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor MT5400</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolled out to great fanfare in 2021, the Black Bay Fifty-Eight 925, and its sibling the Black Bay Fifty-Eight 18K, spotlighted below, are the first members of the now-extensive Black Bay family in cases made of precious metals. The tarnish-resistant alloy used for the case of the 925 (the number refers to the 92.5 percentage of pure sterling silver in the alloy) is, like the all-bronze bracelet of the previous model, a rarity in today’s watch world, more brilliant in its gleam than steel while also slightly more dense. The taupe-colored dial and matching bezel insert are also eye-catching and create an elegant contrast with the silver-gilded elements including the dive-scale numerals and the frames of the hands and hour indexes. Automatic Caliber MT5400 beats within this very special case, in which even the crown and its tube are made of 925 silver, and does so behind a sapphire exhibition caseback, another Tudor rarity. There’s no silver bracelet (yet), but the Black Bay Fifty-Eight 925 is available on either a brown leather strap with a silver buckle or a taupe-colored fabric strap with a jaunty silver stripe in the middle. </span></p><h4>Gold Treasure: Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight 18K Ref. M79018V-0001</h4><p><img alt="Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight 18K" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-18k-2_b6cfd663-429f-4806-849a-70de42e617ae.jpg?v=1662060063"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $16,825, Case Size: 39mm, Case Thickness: 11.9mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5402/MT5400</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most expensive and exclusive Black Bay Fifty-Eight timepiece is the 18K edition, so named for its 39mm case made of 18k yellow gold, once the most popular gold alloy for watches and jewelry but now possessing more of a niche, retro appeal in the modern era in which rose gold reigns supreme. The case, which maintains the same 200-meter water resistance as its siblings in more conventional metals, has a brushed finish for an appropriately understated look. The familiar “snowflake” handset is also made from 18k yellow gold, making for a pleasing contrast with the deep green dial, framed by a gold bezel whose aluminum dive-scale insert is dressed in the same colors (dark green with gold-colored details). As one might expect, the watch showcases its in-house movement — the same Caliber MT5400 that powers the other non-steel variants, with a 28,800-vph frequency and 70-hour power reserve — behind its sapphire exhibition caseback. The Black Bay Fifty Eight 18k is thus far delivered only on a dark brown alligator leather strap with an 18k yellow-gold buckle, with an additional green fabric strap with a gold stripe — at least until Tudor fans are properly braced for the inevitable sticker shock of a version on a full-yellow-gold Oyster bracelet.</span></p><h4><b>Travel Time: Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight GMT, Ref. M7939G1A0NRU-0001, M7939G1A0NRU-0002</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-GMT-flat-2_beae33d1-e627-4e32-93c7-0f7421252818_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714154091"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Price: $4,400 - $4,600 Case Size: 39mm, Case Thickness: 12.8mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 200 meters, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5450-U</i></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tudor introduced the first GMT model in the 41mm Black Bay line in 2018, taking the classical design of the Rolex GMT-Master (made by Tudor’s parent company) and giving it a contemporary spin that is also distinctly 21st-Century Tudor, with a bezel sporting a bicolor 24-hour ring on which the wearer can read a second time zone thanks to the dial’s GMT hand. In 2024, the 39mm version of this popular watch joined the Black Bay subfamily. The steel case of the Black Bay 58 GMT will fit the bill for many wearers with its 12.8mm thickness and 47.8mm lug-to-lug measurement. Its bicolor 24-hour bezel has a glossier finish for a more vibrant aesthetic, the “snowflake” handset has added layers of Super-LumiNova for legibility, and the movement inside is the automatic Caliber MT5440-U, boasting both a COSC certification as well as a METAS certification as a “Master Chronometer; its power reserve is 65 hours, just shy of the 70 hours offered by the non-GMT-equipped base caliber. The Black Bay 58 GMT comes on either a sporty black rubber strap or the classic, Tudor riveted steel bracelet.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more history behind the Tudor Black Bay, and an overview of the entire Black Bay collection, click <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/tudor-black-bay">here.</a></span></i></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than just about any other watchmaker, Japan's Seiko has become known for offering not only multiple styles and complications in its product families, but also several different types of movements — from affordable quartz, to proprietary hybrid Spring Drive, to high-tech solar and radio-controlled, to classically traditional mechanical. However, one Holy Grail combo that has eluded Seiko and its fans until very recently is the rare GMT (aka dual-time) watch powered by a mechanical movement and priced at what most would consider entry-level for a budding collector. Fortunately, the past few years of R&amp;D have yielded several all-new GMT-equipped, self-winding mechanical movements for the Japanese megabrand, which have found their way into several models in its modern collections. Here’s a guide to familiarize yourself with all the Seiko mechanical GMTs on the market now — and yes, all of them offer the enticing value proposition that has made Seiko a darling of enthusiasts at every level of economic means.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SEIKO 5 SPORTS</b></span></h4><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Seiko 5 Sports series traces its roots all the way back to 1963 and the original Seiko Sportsmatic 5, a groundbreaking timepiece that ushered in the emblematic “five attributes” that define Seiko’s entry-level mechanical collection today. These include automatic movements, date or day/date displays in a single window, water resistance, a recessed crown at 4 o’clock, and a case and bracelet made of durable materials. Stylistically, the watches run the gamut from dress watches to field watches to divers, with all kinds of variations in between. Relaunched in 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Seiko 5 Sports watches still adhere to those five principles initially laid out more than half a century ago while still retaining the famously inexpensive price points that have made them so desirable — from under $100 to around $500 for the more exclusive editions. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SSK001, SSK003, SSK005 (SKX Series)</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-5-Sports-GMT-orange-2_c296d8a2-1f49-4b95-8245-8e2718e81211_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714055212"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $475, Case Size: 42.5mm, Thickness: 13.4mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Hardlex, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Seiko 4R34</span></i></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Seiko introduced the first GMT complication to the Seiko 5 sports line in 2022, equipping the watches with the Japanese brand’s automatic Caliber 4R34, a recently introduced in-house movement that offers a daily accuracy between +45/-35 seconds per day and a power reserve of 41 hours. The initial three GMT models — in the classic SKX configuration paying homage to one of Seiko’s most fondly remembered, discontinued dive-watch series — come in three colorways for the dial and bezel: blue, black, and the orange version featured here, each with a central GMT hand in a contrasting color. The distinctively styled hour and minute hands keep the time on bubble-shaped indexes. The GMT hand, coated in Seiko’s proprietary LumiBrite material for nighttime legibility, is used in coordination with the bicolor, day/night 24-hour bezel, with a ring made of Hardlex glass like the crystal, to indicate a second time zone. Also evoking the much-beloved SKX series, the watches in the Sport 5 GMT family have five-link steel bracelets with polished middle rows.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SSK023, SSK025 (Field Series)</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-5-Sports-Field-GMT-pair-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714055263"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $435, Case Size: 39.4mm, Thickness: 13.6mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Crystal: Hardlex, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Seiko 4R34</span></i></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">With its dive watches well-established, the Seiko 5 collection branched out into military-flavored field watches in late 2023, installing the popular Caliber 4R34 into a new 39.4mm steel case (black PVD-coated in the Ref. SSK025 model) with a reduced but still robust water resistance of 100 meters. The dials differ from those of the SKX-influenced watches in their use of Arabic numerals and more conventional sword hands, as well as an inner 24-hour scale within the main 12-hour ring that is reminiscent of early field watches. As on the diving models, the central GMT hand is executed in a bright, contrasting color, and points to a second time zone on a 24-hour scale, this one etched into a simple steel bezel, sans bicolor sectors. The movement is on display behind a clear caseback, and the watches are mounted on either a five-link metal bracelet or, for a more military-authentic look, a pull-through leather NATO-style strap.</span></p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>SEIKO PROSPEX</b></span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seiko launched its first diver’s watch in 1965 (which was also the first diver’s watch made in Japan) and its pioneering spirit lives on in the modern Prospex collection — which today encompasses not only a wide variety of dive watches, many paying tribute to the brand’s milestone pieces from the 1960s and 1970s — but also other types of sports- and tool-oriented timepiece models for “land, sea, and air.” Prospex watches are built to be reliable in both toughness and timekeeping accuracy (Hence the umbrella term “Prospex” for the diverse collection, which stands for “Professional Specifications.”) and contain a variety of Seiko movements, from quartz to </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/grand-seiko-spring-drive"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to mechanical, and even solar-powered, as in the Speedtimer chronograph models. It is within the “sea” and “land” sub-families that we find GMT watches with fully mechanical movements. </span></p><h4><strong>Prospex Sea: </strong><b>SPB381, SPB383 Prospex 1968 Diver’s Modern Re-Interpretation</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-Prospex-1968-Diver-GMT-green-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714058720"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $1,500, Case Size: 42mm, Thickness: 12.9mm, Lug-to-Lug: 48.6mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Water Resistance: 200m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Seiko 6R54</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, even though Seiko’s Prospex line essentially started in 1965 (though the Prospex "X" logo didn’t appear on dials until much later), it wasn’t until 2023 that a Prospex GMT dive watch was outfitted with a mechanical self-winding movement; previous GMTs in the collection contained quartz or Spring Drive calibers. For this milestone, Seiko chose as its host model the modern-day version of one of its most historically popular dive watches, launched in 1968. The triumvirate comprising the initial wave of Prospex 1968 Diver’s Modern Reinterpretation GMT models includes the SPB381, with a green dial and bezel, the SPB383, with those elements in black; and the limited-edition SPB385, with an ice-blue dial, a dark blue bezel, and an added strap made of recycled plastic. The cases measure 42mm in steel and 48.6mm lug-to-lug (fairly understated in the arena of Seiko dive watches); the dials are sunray-finished, with large, luminous geometric hour markers and an arrow-tipped GMT hand. With the Prospex occupying a higher tier of pricing than the 5 Sports line, these models also offer upgraded details in terms of the crystal (made of sapphire) and, most notably, the movement, the self-winding Caliber 6R54, whose power reserve is a full three days, or 72 hours. The 200-meter water resistant cases feature solid, screwed casebacks and three-link steel bracelets with a high level of brushed and polished finishing.</span></p><h4><b>Prospex Land: SPB377, SPB379 “Alpinist” GMT</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-Prospex-Alpinist-GMT-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714059520" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $1,150, Case Size: 39.5mm, Thickness: 13.6mm, Lug-to-Lug: 46.4mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Water Resistance: 200m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Seiko 6R54</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prospex “Land” family is centered around the so-called “Alpinist,” a model that traces its history all the way back to 1959 — several years </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the dive watch that kicked off the Prospex collection. As its nickname implies, that vintage model, actually called the “Laurel Alpinist,” was targeted at outdoorsmen such as mountain climbers. The modern version, which joined the Prospex series in 2020, takes its cues from a more recent model, the now-classic SARB017 reference from 2006, known for its cathedral hands, wedge-shaped hour markers alternating with vintage-font Arabic numerals, and a mountaineer-specific inner rotating compass bezel operated by an additional crown at 4 o’clock. Seiko added a GMT to the Alpinist line in 2023, equipping it with the same automatic Caliber 6R54 that animates the “Sea'' models, which has been tested for a daily accuracy of -15/+25 seconds. The dials of the GMTs lack the gilt details and magnifying date lens of the original, non-GMT Ref. SPB121, but adds a steel 24-hour GMT bezel, an orange-arrow-tipped GMT hand, and a more understated date display in a small round window at 4:30. Both the SPB377 (blue) and SPB379 (black) come on leather straps that match their dials.</span></p><h4><b>SPB411 Land Mechanical GMT Limited Edition 1968</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-Prospex-Land-GMT-1968-LE-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714071088"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $1,500, Case Size: 38.5mm, Thickness: 12.6mm, Lug-to-Lug: 45.2mm, Lug Width: 19mm, Water Resistance: 100m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Seiko 6R54</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other “Land”-based GMT model veers from the Alpinist elements in favor of adopting the aesthetic of Seiko’s first GMT watch with a rotating bezel, which, like the main inspiration for the Prospex GMT divers, dropped in the seminal year of 1968. This contemporary reissue of the watch, called the “Navigator Timer” in its original incarnation, comes in at a very compact 38.5mm diameter in steel, with a dial that faithfully re-creates the vintage model’s details, including the Seiko logo that is lower on the dial than the modern versions. The rotating 24-hour bezel, in conjunction with the thin red GMT hand, allows the wearer to potentially view not just two but three time zones at once. The horseshoe-motif solid caseback protects the Caliber 6R54 movement inside, and the case is mounted on a retro-look five-link steel bracelet. </span></p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>SEIKO PRESAGE </b></span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seiko unveiled its Presage collection in 2016, framing it as the first product family in the Japanese brand’s vast portfolio to be composed entirely of watches with mechanical movements (at least up until 2019, when several Spring Drive models were introduced into the series). Serving as a more elegant alternative to the Prospex models, which received their modern re-branding around the same time, Presage watches utilize the full range of in-house Seiko mechanical calibers and feature 100-meter water resistant cases and sapphire crystals. It is in the Presage collection that Seiko often ventures into the artisanal territory more associated with the prestigious Grand Seiko models, now standing apart from the parent company within their own brand — such as using enamels and high-end, natural-world-inspired textured motifs on their dials. The GMT-equipped Presage models are generally found within the Sharp-Edged sub-family.</span></p><h4><b>Presage Sharp Edged SPB217, SPB219, SPB221, SPB225</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Seiko-Presage-Sharp-Edged-GMT-2_bce2cd10-d46d-43c0-8d13-c5a6ad9c722e_2048x2048.jpg?v=1714069475"></div><div style="text-align: start;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seiko introduced the Sharp Edged family, whose members were distinguished by their intriguing textured dials, into the Presage collection in 2020, adding GMT models to the original group of time-and-date watches a year later. The movement inside these dual-time watches is Seiko’s Caliber 6R64, which you’ll note is one digit off from the 6R54 movements in the Prospex series; this is because in addition to its built-in GMT function and date display, this movement also drives an analog power-reserve indicator for the movement’s 45 hours of running autonomy (which is, of course, a downgrade from Caliber 6R54’s 72 hours, though the movement offers the same +25/-15-second daily accuracy). At just over 42mm in diameter, the Presage Sharp Edged GMT sits comfortably on the wrist thanks to sloping lugs; the case’s finish combines polishing and brushing at a level rarely found at this price point. The GMT bezel that frames the dial is made of steel and coated with Seiko’s fade-resistant DiaShield coating. The dial itself is, of course, the star of the show, with its geometric “Asanoha” textured pattern, an ancient Japanese design motif inspired by hemp leaves. The dial colors also take inspiration from Japan’s natural world, like the “Aitetsu” model pictured, whose tone evokes indigo-colored iron ore.</span></div>]]>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rolex GMT-Master II is one of the most coveted luxury travel watches on the planet, and its predecessor, the original, non-numerical GMT-Master, basically established the template that other dual-time zone timepieces have been following for more than half a century. Here is a detailed look at the history and evolution of the GMT-Master II, from its aviation-inspired beginnings in 1954 to the iconic status it enjoys in the modern era, with all the major models spotlighted in between.</span></p><h4><strong>1954: “PEPSI” FOR PILOTS</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolex, the luxury watch firm founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf, achieved one of its many milestones in 1953 with the launch of the Oyster Perpetual Submariner, the first serially produced wristwatch with a case water-resistant to 100 meters and hence one of the first and most influential watches purpose-built for diving. If the watch community was wondering what Rolex could possibly do for an encore, they didn’t have long to discover the answer. The following year, 1954, saw the introduction of another trend-setting, genre-defining timepiece, the original Rolex GMT-Master (Ref. 6542, which actually hit the market in 1955), the first watch capable of displaying the time in two separate time zones thanks to the clever addition of a fourth, central 24-hour hand and a bidirectional rotating 24-hour bezel. The initials in the watch’s name signify “Greenwich Mean Time,” the system of world timekeeping based on the calculation of mean solar time from the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Rolex GMT-Master 1955" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-1955-3.jpg?v=1658264000"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dual-time functionality of the GMT-Master was an innovation devised for, and developed in cooperation with, the original watch’s intended users: the pilots of Pan American Airlines, at the time one of the U.S.A.’s leading commercial carriers. In that so-called Golden Age of commercial aviation, the growth of long-haul and international flights prompted the desire for a tool watch upon which a pilot could keep track of the time in both his home city, and his flight’s destination city, anywhere in the world. While other watch manufacturers, before and since, have established various ways of displaying and tracking two or more time zones, it is Rolex’s design that has proven the most impactful and enduring, and the one most emulated by other brands looking to entice world travelers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Rolex GMT-Master Pan Am ad" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-PanAm-ad-2.jpg?v=1658323261"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first-generation GMT-Master Ref. 6452 — which was based in part on an existing watch in Rolex’s portfolio, the Datejust Turn-o-Graph, the brand’s first watch with a rotating bezel — had a steel Oyster case measuring 38mm in diameter, a black dial with Rolex’s now-hallmark “Mercedes” handset, a 3 o’clock date window under a magnifying “Cyclops” lens, and most remarkably from a historical standpoint, a bidirectional bezel with an insert made of Bakelite, graduated to 24 hours and divided into two equal sectors of red and blue, a clever and eye-catching visual shorthand to identify daytime and nighttime hours on the 24-hour scale. Because the original Bakelite bezel insert proved to be brittle and prone to cracking (and because its luminous, radium coating was mildly radioactive), it was replaced by an anodized aluminum version in later versions of the Ref. 6452, which was produced through 1959, and in all subsequent models throughout the 20th century. The movement in Ref. 6452 was Caliber 1036, Rolex’s first GMT-enabled movement, in which the GMT hand was connected to the central 12-hour hand, necessitating the use of the rotating bezel to read an additional time zone.</span></p><p><img alt="Rolex GMT-Master dial CU" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-dialCU-2.jpg?v=1658323319"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red-and-blue coloration of the original GMT-Master’s bezel — which was, as one might logically expect, actually inspired by Pan Am’s famous red-and-blue livery — brought to mind for many the logo of a popular soft drink of the time, forever tagging the model with the nickname “Pepsi.” Much like the Submariner that preceded it to market, the GMT-Master would also find itself linked to the James Bond cinematic canon after a legendary onscreen appearance: actress Honor Blackman, as Pussy Galore, wore it in 1965’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldfinger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and her character’s double-entendre name would enjoy an enduring identification with the model as well. The GMT-Master was also, notably, the first Rolex sports watch to be offered in gold versions, which swiftly followed the steel originals. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore wearing Rolex" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Honor-Blackman-Rolex-3.jpg?v=1658332203"></span></p><h4><strong>1983: THE FAT LADY SINGS FOR A COKE</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ref. 1675 version of the GMT-Master, which replaced the 6452 series, had a long production run from 1959 through 1980, and introduced gilt dials (in addition to matte versions), new dial detail variations, new crown guards on the case, and a new generation of movements to the collection (Calibers 1565 and 1575, the latter adding a quick-set date). Some rare and collectible models (and their accompanying nicknames) emerged from this era as well. There was a version in the late ‘60s, nicknamed “Pink Panther” by collectors (below), that used a bright fuschia, rather than the standard red, for the daytime sector of the bezel; and an all-gold model with a brown-colored bezel whose luxurious character led to its being dubbed “Concorde,” after the supersonic, transatlantic airliner flown by the Jet Set. All of these models, including the Ref. 16750 that followed on the heels of the 1675 and had its moment of fame as the watch worn by Tom Selleck in the hit 1980s series “Magnum, P.I.,” set the stage for the first major technical and visual evolution of the Rolex GMT-Master, which arrived in 1983.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt='Rolex GMT-Master II "Pink Panther"' src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-Pink-Panther-2.jpg?v=1658338913"></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ref. 16760, also known as the first GMT-Master II (below), ushered in the modern era for the watch industry’s most historically significant traveler’s watch. Its 40mm steel case housed Rolex’s new Caliber 3085, which boasted a subtle but technically sophisticated upgrade: it decoupled the arrow-tipped GMT hand from the main (local time) hour hand, enabling the user to independently adjust the latter in one-hour increments without interfering with the seconds, minutes, or GMT hands, resulting in an easier adjustment of the local time and the ability to read a third time zone on the rotating bezel in addition to a second one. Most significantly, the GMT bezel sported a new color combo — red for daytime hours, black for nighttime — and a new soda-inspired nickname: “Coca-Cola” or “Coke.” The reference is also known to Rolex cognoscenti as the “Fat Lady,” for its thicker case to accommodate the new movement; or (somewhat conversely) the “Sophia Loren,” for the case’s redesigned, more ergonomic curves. The GMT-Master II Ref. 16760 was also the first Rolex to use white-gold for dial details like the indexes, a practice which is now common throughout Rolex’s line. The 16760 begat the longer-running 16710 model series, which was produced up until 2007, when the next level of Rolex technical innovation arrived to transition the 1950s descendant into the modern era. The now functionally humbler but still beloved original GMT-Master would end its run at the cusp of the new millennium, in 1999, with the Ref. 16700.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt='Rolex GMT-Master II "Coke"' src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-1982-3.jpg?v=1658264106"></span></p><h4><strong>2013: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Rolex became a more vertically integrated watch manufacturer in the first decade of the 21st century, updates to both the interior and exterior of many of its iconic watches started coming fast and furious. For the GMT-Master II, these changes began in earnest with the version released in 2005 — not coincidentally, the original model’s 50th anniversary on the market. It had a larger case (40mm), customary of that era, in gold, and its new Caliber 3816 movement incorporated Rolex’s Parachrom hairspring, which rendered it more resistant to shocks and temperature variations than its predecessors. The case featured the waterproof Triplock crown that Rolex had previously used in its Submariner and Sea-Dweller dive watches and was attached to a more luxurious bracelet with polished center links and a machined clasp.  The bezel, for the first time, was in a scratch-resistant ceramic called Cerachrom and came in one color: black. In 2007 came the first steel models with Cerachrom inserts, heralding the permanent replacement of the aluminum bezel inserts across the line with new ones made of the ceramic material. The decision also meant that the bicolor bezels that had for so long defined the GMT-Master models — particularly the history-steeped “Pepsi” and “Coke” iterations — were phased out indefinitely, as neither Rolex nor any other watchmaker at the time had the manufacturing capacity to make them out of ceramics; developing satisfactory ceramic parts in a red color was particularly difficult.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Rolex GMT-Master II 50th Anniversary YG" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-2005-YG-2.jpg?v=1658332649"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolex achieved the next milestone in 2013, producing the first two-color bezel insert in Cerachrom and debuting it, appropriately, on that year’s headliner model, the GMT-Master II Ref. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">116710BLNR. The watch’s color combo of black for night and dark blue for day was a first for the long-running series and ultimately inspired yet another now-famous nickname for a GMT-Master model: “Batman” (after other early monikers like “Bruiser” and “Phantom” failed to stick). To create the bezel, Rolex developed a patented process in which a single piece of blue ceramic has black color added to half its surface area while the ceramic is still permeable; the 24-hour gradations, engraved into the ceramic after it has hardened, are coated with a thin layer of platinum and then the entire bezel is diamond-polished to a high gloss. The process ensures that the bezel’s colors won’t fade (or “tropicalize,” to use the watch collectors’ jargon) over years of exposure to ultraviolet rays but remain vibrant. Rolex’s continuing push into patented technologies and luxurious materials were also evident in the “Batman” model, which had white gold hands sweeping over a black lacquered dial, Rolex’s blue-glowing Chromalight substance on the hands and indexes, and, ticking inside, the automatic (“Perpetual”) Caliber 3816 with a COSC chronometer certification and a 48-hour power reserve.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt='Rolex GMT-Master II "Batman" Jubilee bracelet' src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-Batman-Jubilee-2.jpg?v=1658332705"></span></p><h4><strong>2018: A PEPSI JUBILEE &amp; A ROOT BEER REDUX</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only a year after "Batman's" debut that Rolex’s braintrust managed to solve the vexing problem of creating a red-and-blue bicolor ceramic bezel, which famously made its debut on the GMT-Master II Ref. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">116719BLRO, which marked both the return of the crowd-pleasing “Pepsi” model and the first GMT-Master in a case made of 18k white gold. Rolex consulted with a team of scientists in its quest to develop the in-house, patented process that produces the bezel, which adds chromium oxide, magnesium oxide and rare earth oxide to the ceramic’s aluminum oxide base to achieve the red color that was heretofore next to impossible to replicate with natural pigments. The expensive process, and the years of intensive R&amp;D that went into perfecting it, meant that the "Pepsi" bezels would initially only be available in a white-gold version, which by its very nature would be limited in production. </span></p><p><img alt='Rolex GMT-Master II "Pepsi" steel' src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-Pepsi-2.jpg?v=1658339102"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years later, however, Rolex finally gave the clamoring hordes what they wanted: a GMT-Master II with a Cerachrom Pepsi bezel and a case made of 904L stainless steel (which Rolex calls “Oystersteel”), which was mounted on the five-link “Jubilee” bracelet (created for the Datejust in 1945) rather than the now-standard three-link Oyster bracelet. The watch (Ref. 126710BLRO) served as the centerpiece to a big year for the GMT-Master II in 2018, which marked the most recent update of the model’s movement and also introduced yet another highly coveted bicolor bezel treatment.</span></p><p><img alt="Rolex GMT-Master II Pepsi Jubilee bracelet" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-Pepsi-Jubilee-wrist-2.jpg?v=1658327383"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolexophiles (who count among their ranks many fans of sugary drinks, apparently) first used the nickname “Root Beer” in reference to a watch from 1970 (Ref. 1675/3), which had a bicolor brown-and-gold-colored GMT bezel and became somewhat famous as the personal watch of actor/director Clint Eastwood, making appearances on screen in several of his films. In 2018, the name was resurrected for the GMT-Master II Refs. 126715CHNR and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">126711CHNR (the former in Rolex’s proprietary Everose gold alloy, the latter in two-tone steel-and-gold “Rolesor”), which were distinguished by black-and-brown Cerachrom bezels.</span></p><p><img alt='Rolex GMT-Master II "Root Beer"' src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-RootBeer-2_ab5f46be-4b0b-4ced-8d24-94f7c1eedfa6.jpg?v=1658327956"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With both the Oystersteel “Pepsi” and the Everose gold and Rolesor “Root Beers,” Rolex marked yet another technical milestone: starting with those 2018 models, all GMT-Masters going forward, including the “Batman” on a Jubilee bracelet that followed in 2019, would be equipped with the in-house Caliber 3285, which boasts no less than 10 patent applications. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among its technical talking points are the aforementioned blue Parachrom hairspring, the energy efficient, magnetic-resistant Chronergy escapement, and the increased power reserve of approximately 70 hours. As of 2015, Rolex has established its own “Superlative Chronometer” certification, which is touted on the watch’s black lacquered dial;  its criteria of -2/+2 seconds per day of precision is even stricter than those necessary to obtain the prestigious COSC chronometer certificate.</span></p><h4><strong>2022: LEFT-HANDED COMPLEMENT</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Watches &amp; Wonders 2022 in Geneva, Rolex took advantage of its very first participation in that international luxury watch fair to unveil the latest — and probably most unexpected — version of the GMT-Master II, with the crown, crown guards, and Cyclops date window all shifted to the left-hand side of the case. It’s one of the still very rare luxury watches aimed at left-handed wearers, and the first one from Rolex to enter mainstream production. Of course, such a milestone couldn’t be celebrated without a corresponding new colorway, and Rolex delivers that with the watch’s green-and-black bicolor Cerachrom bezel, which tops the 40mm, 100-meter water resistant Oystersteel case. </span></p><p><img alt="Rolex GMT-Master II lefthand green-black" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-lefthand-2022-2.jpg?v=1658326966"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The left-handed orientation meant that Rolex had to revise its Superlative Chronometer testing process for the Caliber 3285 that beats inside, ensuring that it offers the same elite levels of precision, robustness, and power reserve as it does in the right-handed models. The watch (Ref. 126720VTNR) comes on an Oyster bracelet with the patented Oysterlock safety clasp, which prevents accidental opening, and the Easylink extension device, which can adjust the bracelet length up to 5mm for wearing comfort. For the moment, Rolex says, the green-black color combo will be exclusive to this special southpaw edition. The only open question regarding the left-handed GMT-Master II seems to be about which official/unofficial nickname bestowed by Rolex fandom will have staying power. “Hulk” and “Kermit” are already spoken for by green-dominant models in the Submariner range. A couple years down the road from the model's launch, the front-runners appear to be the beverage-oriented “Sprite” and “Starbucks,” while some are going with the comics-derived "Green Lantern."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Rolex GMT-Master II green-black" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-green-black-CU-2.jpg?v=1658328916"></span></p><h4><strong>2024: SHADES OF GREY</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Watches &amp; Wonders 2024, Rolex introduced two new GMT-Master II models in Oystersteel cases, both featuring a new gray-and-black bicolor bezel made of high-tech ceramic. The bezel’s color graduated effect is made more pronounced on these models thanks to the use of a PVD treatment on the molded, recessed numbers used for the 24-hour scale. Also displaying Rolex’s traditional level of technical prowess and attention to functional detail, the ceramic used for the bezel is inert and thus will not corrode over time, and its knurled edge makes it easy to grip when switching time zones. The black lacquer dial has the name “GMT-Master” printed in green, echoing the color of the arrow-tipped central GMT hand. One model is mounted on Rolex’s classic three-link Oyster bracelet, the other on the five-link Jubilee bracelet, both in Oystersteel and equipped with the Oysterlock folding safety clasp and the Easylink extension that allows for 5 mm worth of adjustment. The nickname that appears to have attached to this one, at least so far, is “Bruce Wayne,” Batman’s millionaire philanthropist alter ego, perhaps due to its more sober black-to-gray color scheme that evokes elegant cocktail attire.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-2024-2_d69fa48b-e668-4abc-ad87-f90e7a8eb2f6_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713986879"></div>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s been making its timepieces in Switzerland since the 1970s, Hamilton Watch Company, founded in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1892, has few peers when it comes to being a vital thread in the historical tapestry of American watchmaking. The heritage brand, today a part of the Swiss Swatch Group conglomerate of companies, continues to lean heavily into its New World roots for its diverse collection of product families, which ranges from military tool watches to sporty divers, from elegantly appointed dress pieces to retro-futuristic curiosities — while also maintaining a price-to-value ratio for which the brand has long been renowned. It can fairly be said that there is a Hamilton watch for just about everyone, no matter what style they’re seeking. Here, in the tradition of our previous guide to the best <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/best-longines-watches">Longines watches,</a> we run down 10 of our favorite Hamilton watches that run the stylistic gamut from sporty to dressy, from high-tech to classically mechanical.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">For the Military Buff: </b><b data-mce-fragment="1">Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Khaki-Field-Mechanical-2_c13ef35b-46f9-4191-94e7-e48e22d5b9fb_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713882611" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><i data-mce-fragment="1">Price: $595, Case Size: 38mm, Thickness: 9.5mm, Lug width: 20mm, Lug to Lug: 47mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 50 meters, Movement: Mechanical Hamilton Caliber H-50</i></span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Field watches are an enduringly popular category of timepiece, and without Hamilton, the style as we know it might not even exist. Hamilton basically invented the genre with the “trench watches” that it supplied to American troops during World War I, kicking off a long tradition of making tough, simple, reliable timepieces for U.S. military units. The most direct inspiration for Hamilton’s </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/hamilton-khaki-field?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_best-field-watches" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/hamilton-khaki-field?utm_term=In_Article_link&amp;utm_content=Blog_Article_best-field-watches"><span data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Khaki Field</span></a><span data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> family of general-purpose, military-inspired watches is the 1960s model worn by troops during the Vietnam War, which were built according to strict specifications by the U.S. Defense Department, including high resistance to magnetism and moisture, hacking seconds, and accuracy between +/- 30 seconds per day. Khaki Field watches today are available in a wide range of colorways, and with quartz, manually wound mechanical, or self-winding mechanical movements. The Khaki Field Mechanical, the models most true to their historic predecessor, combines the classically retro 12/24-hour dial with a period-accurate 38mm case and a nylon NATO strap of the type that soldiers would have worn in the field during wartime. The manually winding Caliber H-50 beats inside, storing a lengthy 80-hour power reserve.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">For the Frequent Flier: </b><b data-mce-fragment="1">Hamilton Khaki Aviation Pilot Pioneer Mechanical Chrono</b><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Khaki-Aviation-Mechanical-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713882746"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,095, Case Size: 40mm, Thickness: 14.35mm, Lug width: 22mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Mechanical Hamilton Caliber H-51-Si</span></i></p><p data-mce-fragment="1">As they did for the troops on the ground, Hamilton watches have also found their way to the wrists of military aviators in the cockpits of jets. The Khaki Aviation Pilot Pioneer Mechanical Chrono, which rolled off the runway in 2022, takes its aesthetic inspiration specifically from Hamilton watches issued to British RAF pilots in the 1970s. The watch’s barrel-shaped 40mm stainless steel case and black grained bicompax dial is reminiscent of the historical models, as are the dial’s vintage typography and sword hands, the box-shaped sapphire crystal, and the rugged calfskin strap. Powering the watch is Hamilton’s proprietary Caliber H-51-Si, a manually wound chronograph movement with a 60-hour power reserve and a high degree of resistance to magnetic fields thanks to its silicon balance spring.</p><h4><b>For the Dedicated Diver: Hamilton Khaki Navy Scuba Auto</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Khaki-Navy-Automatic-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713883883"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Price: $795, Case Size: 40mm, Thickness: 12.95mm, Lug width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Automatic Hamilton Caliber H-10</i></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamilton’s World War II-era “Frogman” diver’s watch was significant in several respects, in that it was one of the earliest models the American brand made for U.S. Navy underwater demolition experts (aka “frogmen”) and also the first Hamilton watch featured in a movie (you guessed it, 1951’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Frogmen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which would start a longstanding relationship between the watchmaker and the film industry. Channeling the spirit of the Frogman models is another branch of Hamilton’s military-influenced Khaki family, the Khaki Navy Scuba. The watch comes in at a wearable 40mm (scaled down from its bulky 46mm predecessor; a more midrange 43mm size is also available) and features a unidirectional dive-scale bezel with a bicolor ceramic insert spotlighting the first 15-minute sector in a contrasting color. The dial has large, luminous triangular and rectangular markers, a colorful tip for the seconds hand, and a date display at 4:30. The proprietary Hamilton Caliber H-10, with automatic winding and an impressive 80-hour power reserve, beats inside.</span></p><h4><b>For the Retro Rock ‘n’ Roller: Hamilton Ventura</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Ventura-2_899331c0-9916-4a76-baa6-b5758e005c06_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713884604"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we explore in much more detail <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/hamilton-ventura-elvis">here</a>, Hamilton introduced the world to the first electronic watch, the Ventura, in 1957. Unconventional in its design as well as its technology, the Ventura would enter the annals of both cinematic and rock ‘n’ roll history when it was worn by Elvis Presley — at the time, arguably the biggest star in the world — in the 1961 film, <i>Blue Hawaii. </i>The original Ventura was notable not only for its unusual, futuristic curved case design but for its movement, Caliber 500, which used a battery, magnets, and an electronic coil rather than a mainspring to drive the gear train and balance wheel. The Ventura remains a presence in Hamilton's collection today, though modern models are now equipped with quartz or mechanical movements rather than the now-outdated electronic mechanism — and versions of the watch have continued to make their presence felt on the silver screen, in movies such as <i>Men in Black</i> and <i>Dune II.</i>  It remains one of the most uniquely iconoclastic designs in the watch world, with the lightning-bolt motif on its dial and the shield-shaped case that calls to mind the contours of a guitar.</span></p><h4><b>For the Chronograph Classicist: Hamilton American Classic Intra-Matic Auto Chrono</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"></div><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Intra-Matic-Auto-Chrono-blue-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713887370" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,295, Case Size: 40mm, Thickness: 14.45mm, Lug-to-Lug: 49mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Water Resistance: 100m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Hamilton Caliber H-31 (ETA Valjoux 7750 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1960s, Hamilton joined forces with a consortium of other watchmakers in the quest to develop the first self-winding mechanical chronograph calibers. The result of their collaboration is the now-legendary Caliber 11, which found a home in the Heuer Carrera and Monaco, the Breitling Chronomat, and Hamilton’s Chrono-Matic, whose retro look lives on in today’s Intra-Matic Auto Chrono, part of the brand’s vintage-inspired American Classics series. The watch is based largely on the pre-Caliber 11 model that hit the market a year earlier, in 1968, and features a 40mm steel case with elongated lugs, pump-stye pushers, and a large, right-side-mounted crown. Its "Panda" dial, here in dark blue, has an outer white tachymeter scale, applied hour markers with luminescent inserts, and two parallel, snail-finished white subdials for running seconds and 30 elapsed chronograph minutes. A vintage-style Hamilton logo appears at 12 o’clock. The movement is the automatic Hamilton Caliber H-31, based on the ETA 7750, which maintains a 60-hour power reserve.</span></p><h4><b>For the Art Deco Iconoclast: Hamilton American Classic Boulton Mechanical</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Boulton-Automatic-2_2fdc131f-46d0-4cab-94e4-f9047d087280_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713887214"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price:</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">$945, Case size: 34.5mm x 38mm, Thickness: 11.2mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 50 meters, Movement: Manually wound Caliber H-50 (ETA 2801-2 base)</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamilton introduced its original Boulton timepiece in the 1940s, an era dominated by non-round watches and Art Deco design elements. Today the watch lives on as another pillar of the American Classics series, in most respects in very period-appropriate form. The watch has hand-winding mechanical movement, the ETA-based Caliber H-50, and a softly rounded rectangular case (which actually leans a bit into tonneau territory). Its dial is defined by radially angled, black Roman hour numerals and a railroad minute track. The leaf-shaped hands are blued and polished, the crown is knurled, and the sapphire crystal is domed to continue the curvilinear contours of the steel case. When fully wound, the movement boasts a weekend-proof power reserve of 80 hours.</span></p><h4><b>For the Proud Cyber-Nerd: Hamilton American Classic PSR Digital Quartz</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-American-Classic-PSR-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713897088"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $995, Case Size: 40.8mm, Lug to Lug: 34.7mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 100 meters, Movement: Quartz Digital</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most “techie” model in the American Classics family, the Hamilton PSR recalls the brand’s short-lived but historically significant Pulsar digital watch of the 1970s. (You might recall seeing the latter model on the wrist of Roger Moore’s James Bond </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/james-bond-watches"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live and Let Die</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) The modern watch features a 40.8 x 34.7-mm cushion-style case, in brushed steel or gold PVD-coated steel, bearing a laser-engraved Hamilton logo on its lower right side. The case’s side-mounted button is used to illuminate the digital display,  whose simple presentation has red digital LED numerals on the black screen while idle and switches to brighter OLED numerals (organic light-emitting diodes) when the button is pressed to reveal the time. The 100-meter water-resistant case connects to a three-link bracelet with a folding clasp and contains a Swiss-made quartz movement.</span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>For the Urban Cosmopolite: Broadway Day Date Auto</b></span></h4><p></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Broadway-Day-Date-Auto-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713898704"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Price:</i><i>$1,045, Case size: 42mm, Thickness: 10.85mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 50 meters, Movement: Automatic Caliber H-30</i></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent product family to join the Hamilton portfolio, the Broadway collection debuted in 2016, taking its name and much of its aesthetic cues from the New York City skyline and specifically its famed Theater District; the name also pays homage to Hamilton’s first series of branded pocket watches, called Broadway Limited and released in the 1860s. Broadway watches have predominantly round, steel cases and dials whose gridlike textured pattern evokes the streets running between the urban towers in Manhattan and whose hands assume the forms of miniature skyscrapers. An anthracite-gray minutes ring adds a subtle nod to the city as “asphalt jungle.” The prominent ridged motif in the dial’s center is echoed on the leather straps; three-link steel bracelets with alternating finishes are also available for most models. The Day-Date Automatic featured here carries Hamilton’s H-30 automatic movement, which incorporates an unconventional display of the day and date, stacked vertically above the 6 o’clock marker. </span></p><h4><b>For the Concert-Hall Regular: Hamilton Jazzmaster Open Heart Auto</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Jazzmaster-OpenHeart-Auto-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713900887"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $1,075, Case Size: 40mm, Thickness: 11.05mm, Lug width: 20mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 50 meters, Movement: Automatic Hamilton Caliber H-10</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s a bit unclear exactly when Hamilton started making watches called “Jazzmaster” (the name seems to start cropping up in the early 2000s), the model has an undeniably timeless appeal in its more conventional three-handed, solid-dial iterations, with classic sword hands and applied baton indexes. Much like jazz itself lends itself to wild improvisation as a musical genre, however, the Jazzmaster has become perhaps best known as a platform for bold technical and aesthetic experiments, particularly in the horological art of skeletonization. Following up the full-skeleton Jazzmaster Viewmatic models of previous years are the recently launched Open Heart editions, which combine dress-watch elegance with just a splash of avant-garde — the latter element represented by the carefully executed dial cutouts that offer tantalizing glimpses into the movement, automatic Caliber H-10, with its pearled and snailed finishes, from the front of the watch. </span></p><h4><b>For the Railroad Historian: Hamilton American Classic Railmaster Pocket Watch</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hamilton-Railroad-Pocket-Watch-2_5a143243-aceb-4ce5-9644-03584178beb9_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713888016"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price:</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,395, Case size: 50mm, Thickness: 12.45mm, Crystal: Sapphire, Water Resistance: 50 meters, Movement: Mechanical ETA Unitas Caliber 6497-1</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 19th and early 20th Century, as railroads began connecting the far reaches of the expanding United States, Hamilton began producing uncommonly sturdy and precise pocket watches that railroad conductors used to keep the trains on time and on schedule. In commemoration of those historical timepieces, Hamilton introduced the Railroad Pocket Watch into the American Classic collection in 2022. Limited to 917 pieces (a number representing the street address of the company’s original factory), the watch has a 50mm case made of stainless steel and a white, “enamel-like” dial with 5-minute markers in bright red along a fully graduated outer minute track. Historically inspired, black lacquered minute hands indicate the hour and minute on large Arabic numerals, while a subdial at 6 o’clock displays the running seconds independently, in the style of vintage railroad timers. The watch’s solid caseback hosts a relief engraving of a train and the words “130th Anniversary Railroad Special.” Behind that caseback beats the hand-wound, Unitas-based mechanical ETA 6497 movement, holding a 50-hour power reserve. The Railroad Pocket Watch’s 50-meter water resistant case connects to a  removable metal chain and is delivered with a leather carrying pouch.</span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/collections/oris" target="_blank">Oris</a> Aquis collection of sporty dive watches is one of the Swiss brand’s most popular — and notably hosted the first Oris watch outfitted with the in-house Caliber 400 — even though it traces its history back just over a decade, to 2011. Like many watch models that catch on strongly with both collectors and casual fans, however, it actually represents the successful evolution of several models that preceded it. Here’s everything you need to know about the Oris Aquis, from its history, to the most prominent models available now, to its central role in Oris’ environmental sustainability initiatives. </p><h3>ORIS ORIGINS AND AQUIS EVOLUTION</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oris, one of the watch world’s few remaining major independent brands, traces its history back to 1904, when it was founded in Hölstein, in the German-speaking Swiss canton of Basel-Landschaft, by Paul Catlin and Georges Christian. The company, which the co-founders named after a brook near the factory, expanded throughout the early 1900s, at one point becoming the largest employer in Hölstein, with over 300 employees and factories throughout Switzerland. In 1925, Oris began making wrist watches, and in 1928, under the leadership of Christian’s brother-in-law Oscar Herzog, a new era of expansion and innovation began. Oris started making its own escapements in the watershed year of 1938, which also saw the release of the brand’s iconic Big Crown watch with pointer date function. The first automatic Oris watch was launched in 1952, and the company’s first watch custom-built for the growing masses of recreational diving enthusiasts was released in 1965 (below), kicking off the tradition of making robust underwater timepieces that would eventually give birth to the Aquis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Dive-Watches-1965-2.jpg?v=1657204846" alt="Oris dive watches 1965"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first bricks in the foundation of the Aquis collection were laid in 1998, with the Oris Full Steel, a sports watch not specifically aimed at divers, as evidenced by its lack of a unidirectional rotating bezel, but one that established the overall silhouette and performance parameters that would define the Aquis. In 2001, Oris introduced the TT1 (below), a tough sports watch featuring a fusion of high-tech materials that sprang from the watch brand’s partnership with the Williams F1 racing team; the following year saw the the debut of the TT Divers, which adapted the road-racing DNA of the TT1 to the underwater depths, adding a unidirectional divers’ bezel and a generous helping of luminous material on the dial. In 2009, Oris took it to the next level with the introduction of the ProDiver, a massive, 51mm, titanium-cased chronograph with a 1,000-meter water resistance rating, a helium decompression valve, and a scratch-proof ceramic bezel with a patented Rotation Safety System that secured it against accidental repositioning underwater.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-TT1-2.jpg?v=1657214413" alt="Oris TT1 watch"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ProDiver (below) was emphatically not positioned as an everyday watch or even an everyday dive watch, but many of its elements found their way into the first Aquis model, unveiled in 2011. That watch set the familiar, sporty template that still defines the collection today: a 300-meter water-resistant case, usually in steel, with a screw-down crown; a ratcheting unidirectional dive-scale bezel; a domed sapphire crystal over the broad, legible dial; and a set of distinctive lugs that screw securely into the rubber strap or steel bracelet. The first generation of Aquis models, which featured a date window at 6 o’clock, were and still are equipped with the Oris Caliber 733, an automatic movement based on the reliable Selllita SW 200, here enhanced with a signature red rotor, an element Oris introduced to its modified calibers in 2002.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-ProDiver-2009-2.jpg?v=1657214508" alt="Oris ProDiver"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following up the original, time-and-date-only Aquis in 2013 was a technical world’s first: the Aquis Depth Gauge, the first divers’ watch that could measure its wearer’s submerged depth by allowing water to penetrate the case. Its patented system incorporated a channel milled into the extra-thick sapphire crystal, into which water could seep into via a tiny hole at 12 o’clock. With a rubber gasket sealing the joint between crystal and case, the incoming water pressure compresses the air inside the channel, activating a yellow scale on the edge of the dial that indicates how many meters a diver has descended or ascended. The Aquis Depth Gauge had an even bigger case (45.5mm) and an even more robust water resistance (500 meters) than its predecessor, though it used the same Sellita-based movement. With some modifications, the watch remains in the collection today.</span></p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Depth-Gauge-2013-2.jpg?v=1657205113" alt="Oris Aquis Depth Gauge"></p><h3>IN-HOUSE INNOVATIONS</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the 1980s, Oris has prided itself on making only mechanical watches, in contrast to many of its competitors, which switched production to quartz watches during that period. It was only fairly recently, however, that Oris began devoting its resources to making its own movements in-house rather than sourcing them from specialists like ETA and Sellita. In 2014, on the occasion of the company’s 110th anniversary, Oris introduced the aptly named Caliber 110, its first in-house movement in 35 years. (Prior to that, Oris had actually developed more than 200 of its own movements over its long history.) The manually wound caliber, which notably held a 10-day power reserve, begat several offspring, ascending in both numerical names and complication (Caliber 111 added a date display and power reserve, Caliber 112 added a GMT and day/night indicator, et cetera), all of them manually wound, most of them finding their way into models in Oris’ dressy, elegant Artelier collection. The sporty, new-to-the-scene Aquis collection would continue to house outsourced calibers with red Oris rotors (as below) until the second decade of the 21st century.</span></p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Red-Rotor-2.jpg?v=1657205513" alt="Oris red rotor">For its first in-house movement with automatic winding, Caliber 400, introduced to great fanfare and substantial critical acclaim in 2020, Oris committed to going above and beyond the call in the area of technical innovation and user-friendliness. Its two mainspiring barrels hold a 120-hour (five-day) power reserve, its silicon parts contribute to an extreme magnetic resistance to 2,500 gauss (that’s more than the 1,000 gauss of the Rolex Milgauss, a watch noted for its antimagnetic properties), and its highly efficient gear train reduces energy consumption to help ensure a mainspring barrel torque of 85 percent, more than the 70 percent of most automatic movements. On top of all that, Caliber 400 is COSC-certified for chronometric performance and carries a 10-year warranty. Just months after the movement itself was announced to the watch media, it made its debut in the Aquis Date Calibre 400, which would open the floodgates to a new generation of Aquis watches containing the in-house mechanism.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Caliber-400-2.jpg?v=1657210484" alt="Oris Caliber 400"></p><h3>SAVING THE OCEANS</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2021, Oris became one of only a handful of watch companies to be officially designated “climate neutral” by ClimatePartner, an independent climate-action organization that calculates companies’ carbon emissions. The milestone, in which Oris’ current leadership takes pardonable pride, is just the culmination of many environmental initiatives the firm has taken over the years, often in support of endangered marine life and threatened waterways. Many of these collaborations have yielded notable limited-edition timepieces, most of which have come from the Aquis family. The Hammerhead Edition of 2017, with a day-date display and a shark-gray sunburst dial, was developed with a nonprofit whose mission is to study and rescue endangered hammerhead sharks. In 2019, Oris introduced an “Ocean Trilogy” of Aquis models, which included the Clean Ocean Limited Edition, produced in partnership with Pacific Garbage Screening; the Great Barrier Reef Limited Edition, a collaboration between Oris and the Reef Restoration Foundation; and the Blue Whale Limited Edition, a blue-dialed chronograph made in support of Whale and Dolphin Conservation. All three watches were presented in a set, packaged in a special box made of recycled, ocean-recovered PET plastic. </span></p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Hangang-LE-2.jpg?v=1657210720" alt="Oris Hangang Limited Edition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50-piece Carysfort Reef Gold Limited Edition, a rare example of the Aquis GMT model in a gold case, was released in 2020 in support of the Reef Restoration Project, a Key Largo-based nonprofit devoted to rebuilding the damaged Carysfort coral reefs off the Florida Keys. That same year, Oris introduced the Hangang Limited Edition (above) in cooperation with South Korea’s largest NGO, the Korean Federation for Environmental Movements, whose mission is to clean and restore the Hangang River, the Asian country’s most important waterway that supplies drinking water to the 10,000 inhabitants of the capital city of Seoul; the gradient green dial and green ceramic bezel insert of the 2,000-piece limited edition are designed to reflect the waters at the Hangang’s source. To name one final example from 2021, Oris wowed the growing community of green-leaning watch aficionados with the Aquis Upcycle (below), whose colorful dials are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made of PET plastic waste recovered from oceans, in a process that produces random patterns of color that make each dial unique. While most Aquis models are fairly masculine in their case dimensions, the Upcycle models speak to both men and women, offered in either a 41.5mm or 36.5mm size. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Upcycle-2.jpg?v=1657206211" alt="Oris Aquis Upcycle"></span></p><h4><b>A SUBTLE, SUBSTANTIAL REVAMP</b></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, Oris took a fine-toothed comb to the Aquis collection for a “soft”  redesign meant to streamline the models for both aesthetics and comfort and to bring them more in line with contemporary tastes. The case diameters of the next-generation models remain the same, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with technical updates that render them more wearable, and arguably more stylish, than their predecessors. Oris reworked the lugs and crown protectors; the former have been given a more sculpted treatment that enables them to better hug the wrist, while the latter elements now taper toward the screw-down crown to better guard against accidental shocks and impacts. </span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Date-2024-trio-2_38f195be-a373-4fc9-9a2a-9f5eb5e5f9e0_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713808529"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The steel bracelets’ brushed center links were made broader and more prominent and their overall form is more tapered; on the 43.5mm models, which contain the in-house Caliber 400, they’re also equipped with Oris’s Quick Adjust clasp system, which enables easy loosening or tightening of the fit without removing links. For the dials, Oris created new, polished, shield-shaped applied hour markers and a new set of Alpha-shaped hands, both coated with Super-LumiNova, as well as an entirely new, bespoke typography font. Purists will also appreciate the new date display (below), with high-contrast numerals on background colors that match the dial.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Date-2024-blue-dateCU_8e796e9f-d07a-4fc1-80f7-59399921c39e_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713808433"></div><h3>EXPLORING THE COLLECTION</h3><p>In barely over a decade on the market, the Oris Aquis has established itself as a tentpole collection within the larger Oris portfolio, venturing at times into variations with small seconds displays, chronographs, and large dates. Below we spotlight the most important pillars of the Aquis family and also showcase some of the most notable limited editions, all currently in production as per Oris' website.</p><h4>Aquis Date</h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Date-2024-trio-2_38f195be-a373-4fc9-9a2a-9f5eb5e5f9e0_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713808529"></div><p>At the core of today’s Aquis collection lies the basic three-hand-date model upon which it was founded, still defined by the hallmark design elements of the 2011 original but now offering more variety in case sizes to appeal to a wider range of consumers. At the large end of the range are the 43.5mm models, with the 39.5mm versions at the smaller end and the versatile 41.5mm variants occupying the middle ground. Predominantly in stainless steel (but also offering some titanium options), the cases feature scratch-proof ceramic inserts for the rotating bezel’s dive scale, and screw-down crowns, protected by shoulder-like crown guards, to help secure the impressive 300-meter water resistance. The gradient dial, with the eponymous date displayed at 6 o’clock, features luminous hands and indexes and a lollipop-style central seconds hand. </p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,000 - $2,300, Case Size: 39.55mm/41.5mm/43.5mm, Lug Width: 21mm/22mm/24mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 733 (Sellita SW 200-1 base)</span></i></p><h4>Aquis Date Calibre 400</h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Calibre-400-blue-2.jpg?v=1657206364" alt="Oris Aquis Date Calibre 400">Swiftly building up an enthusiastic following of its own is the relatively new version of the Aquis Date containing the in-house Oris Caliber 400. Outwardly, the Caliber 400 models are mostly indistinguishable from the Aquis Date models that use Oris-modified, outsourced Sellita movements, with baton-shaped hour and minute hands, lollipop seconds hand, and 6 o’clock date window. The differences are evident, however, in the extended power reserve offered by the self-winding Caliber 400 (five days rather than a relatively pedestrian 38 hours) and in the rotor of the movement, visible behind a sapphire caseback, which is skeletonized with a central Oris logo shield, rather than solid red. Thus far, Aquis Calibre 400 models are available in 41.5mm and 43.5mm cases, most in steel, a handful using 18k yellow gold for their bezels.</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,300 - $4,600, Case Size: 41.5mm/43.5mm, Lug Width: 22mm/24mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 400</span></i></p><h4>Aquis Date Relief</h4><p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Relief-red-2.jpg?v=1657206541" alt="Oris Aquis Date Relief red"></b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Relief” in these models’ name refers to the 60-minute dive scale on their unidirectional rotating bezels, which, like the main case, are made of solid steel and eschew the ceramic inserts of the core Aquis Date models. Leaving out the ceramic allows Oris to offer the Relief models at an even more affordable price point than their siblings in the core collection. Aquis Date Relief watches feature cases in either 41.5mm or 43.5mm sizes and contain Sellita-based automatic movements. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $1,930 - $2,200, Case Size: 41.5mm/43.5mm, Lug Width: 22mm/24mm,, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 733 (Sellita SW 200-1 base)</span></i></p><h4>Aquis GMT Date</h4><p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Whale-Shark-2.jpg?v=1657206600" alt="Oris Aquis GMT Whale Shark"></b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most prominent differentiating element in the Aquis GMT Date model — the template for several of the environmentally focused limited editions, including the Carysfort Reef Gold and the recent Whale Shark Limited Edition (above) — is its bezel’s use of a 24-hour GMT scale to indicate a second time zone rather than the traditional 60-minute scale to record dive times. A center-mounted, arrow-tipped hand points to an additional time zone on the bezel’s scale, which rotates in both directions rather than one — which means that even though the GMT Date maintains the impressive 300 meters of water resistance common to the Aquis family, you probably shouldn’t wear one to go diving. The date window on this model is at 3 o’clock rather than 6, and the dial has an additional, inner 24-hour scale surrounding the center for a reading of a potential third time zone. The Oris 798 Caliber inside is based on the Sellita SW 330-1 and stores a 42-hour power reserve. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,600 - $2,800, Case Size: 43.5mm Case Height: 13.06mm,  Lug Width: 24mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 798 (Sellita SW 330-1 base)</span></i></p><h4>Aquis Depth Gauge</h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Depth-Gauge-2021-2.jpg?v=1657209785" alt="Oris Aquis Depth Gauge"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Oris revamped its Aquis Depth Gauge timepiece with three technical developments that enhance its useability: a sapphire crystal with a water channel milled in a new process that increases the accuracy of the depth reading; a new easier-to-read meters-to-feet conversion table engraved on the caseback; and a patented Quick Change adjustment system for the bracelets and straps that allow for easy switching between one and the other (the latter is a feature increasingly common on other Oris models as well). Unchanged from the groundbreaking 2013 original model are the stately 45.8mm case diameter (and 13mm thickness), professional-grade 500-meter water resistance, and Sellita-based Oris 733 self-winding movement.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $3,900 - $4,100, Case Size: 45.8mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 500 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 733 (Sellita SW 200-1 base)</span></i></p><h4>AquisPro Date Calibre 400</h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-AquisPro-Diver-2.jpg?v=1657206686" alt="Oris AquisPro Calibre 400">Most directly descended from the hulking, high-performance ProDiver model of 2009 is the AquisPro Date, Oris’ most extreme” divers’ model in terms of water resistance (1,000 meters, double that of its closest runner-up, the Aquis Depth Gauge, at 500 meters), which as of 2021 became the latest Aquis model equipped with Caliber 400. Its 49.5mm case is made of DLC-coated titanium; its rubber-coated bezel, equipped with the Oris Rotation Safety System, has a lume-coated gray ceramic insert. In addition to its screw-down crown, the case features a helium-release valve at 9 o’clock and a special “safety-anchor” hook system in the bracelet’s clasp that ensures the watch stays attached to a diver’s wrist in the event of accidental disengagement of the clasp. Like the Aquis Depth Gauge, the other Aquis model most suitable for serious diving, the AquisPro’s solid caseback is engraved with a meters-to-feet conversion scale.</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $4,600, Case Size: 45mm, Case Thickness: 17.5mm, Lug Width: 25mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 1,000 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 400</span></i></p><h4>Aquis Dat Watt Limited Edition</h4><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Dat-Watt-LE-2.jpg?v=1657208978" alt="Oris Aquis Dat Watt Limited Edition">Something of an outlier among the Aquis models, which tend to feature “small” complications, the Dat Watt Limited Edition garners attention with its lunar tides complication, elegantly displayed on its gradient blue-gray dial. The watch is another product of a collaboration between Oris and a water-focused charitable organization, in this case the Common Wadden Sea Secratariat, whose mission is the preservation of Europe’s Wadden Sea (“Dat Watt” in the local dialect), the world’s largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world and, as of 2009, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The watch, accordingly limited to 2,009 pieces, uses the Oris-signature central pointer date function to display the lunar cycle and corresponding tidal ranges as well as well as the waxing and waning of the moon. Also distinguishing the Dat Watt edition from other 43.5mm steel Aquis models is its use of tungsten, rather than ceramic, for the dive-scale bezel.</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,750, Case Size: 43.5mm Case Height: 13.63mm, Lug Width: 24mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 761 (Sellita SW 200-1 base)</span></i></p><h4>Aquis Sun Wukong Artist Edition</h4><p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Sun-Wukong-LE-2.jpg?v=1657207984" alt="Oris Sun Wukong Artist Edition"></b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very top tier of both artisanship and price in Oris’ mostly approachable portfolio is the Aquis Sun Wukong Artist Edition, introduced in 2022, which sports a breathtaking cloisonné enamel dial that pays tribute to a scene from a classic Chinese animé film. The intricately executed dial, with its varying shades of blue created by firing multicolored ceramic powders in a kiln before carefully placing them into small compartments, depicts the underwater castle scene from 1961’s “The Monkey King: Uproar in Heaven;” three hands sweep over the scene, which is interrupted by neither hour markers nor a date. Limited to just 72 pieces, the watch uses a 41.5mm case and a steel bezel with a minimalist relief scale. The in-house Caliber 400 beats inside. And while one would likely choose not to dive with this piece of horological art on one’s wrist, the 300-meter water resistance has you covered just in case.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $27,500, Case Size: 41.5mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 400</span></i></p><h4>Aquis Date New York Harbor Limited Edition</h4><p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-NY-Harbor-2.jpg?v=1657206821" alt="Oris Aquis New York Harbor LE"></b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent addition to Oris’s ocean-focused Aquis Limited Editions dropped this past June in New York City. The New York Harbor Limited Edition (of 2,000 pieces), in the 41.5mm version of the multipart Aquis Date case, features the all-steel bezel with relief dive scale of the Aquis Date Relief models. Its green mother-of-pearl dial and engraved caseback are a reference to the ambitious mission of the Billion Oyster Project, a New York-based nonprofit dedicated to restoring and rebuilding the oyster reefs of New York Harbor with the assistance of more than 50 oyster-serving restaurants (who donate used oyster shells) as well as 11,000 volunteers and 8,000 students from 100 area schools. The caseback drives home the theme with its engraved images of oysters.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $2,700, Case Size: 41.5mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Crystal: Domed Sapphire, Water Resistance: 300 meters, Movement: Automatic Oris Caliber 733 (Sellita SW 200-1 base)</span></i></p><strong><em>Click <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/collections/oris?usf_take=48">here</a> to shop our selection of Oris Aquis watches.</em></strong><br><br>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Watches &amp; Wonders 2024, the world's largest international event devoted to fine watches, wrapped up last weekend in Geneva, after a full week in which the Swiss city essentially became a playground for the watch industry and those of us who chronicle it. Once again, the annual event featured new timepieces from an all-star assemblage of more than 50 watch brands, from industry titans to ambitious independents (and that’s not even counting the dozens of brands exhibiting outside the main show, in hotels and other venues throughout Geneva). As in previous years, Teddy and I, along with our ultra-talented photo and video team, attended the event and went hands-on with some of the finest and most intriguing new timepieces unveiled there. Teddy’s impressions of various new releases can be found on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TeddyBaldassarre/videos">YouTube channel;</a> read on to discover my top 22 highlights from Watches &amp; Wonders in various categories.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Dazzling Dial Artistry</span></span></h4><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Grand Seiko SLGH021 “Genbi Valley”</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-Evolution-9-Genbi-Valley-2_b34cbd7f-1128-4589-9e12-446c56098c38_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713384044"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The latest nature-derived dial in Grand Seiko’s Evolution 9 collection makes its debut on the new SLGH021 “Genbi Valley” edition, limited to 1,000 pieces and featuring the first instance of the historically inspired Evolution 9 case executed in the company’s “Ever Brilliant Steel,” said to be the most corrosion-resistant alloy of stainless steel in the world. The Genbi Valley that inspires the watch’s bright blue-green dial is a gorge formed by the erosion of large stones by the Iwai River in Japan’s Iwate Prefecture; it is renowned for the natural beauty of its ravines and waterfalls and is designated as a Place of Scenic Beauty and National Monument of Japan. The 40mm case houses the Caliber 9SA5, with a 36,000-vph frequency and a lengthy 80-hour power reserve. The watch is delivered on an "Ever Brilliant Steel” bracelet.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">H. Moser &amp; Cie. Pioneer Centre Seconds Concept Citrus Green</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/H-Moser-Cie-Concept-Citrus-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713384137"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Schaffhausen-based indie H. Moser &amp; Cie. has garnered a reputation among in-the-know enthusiasts for the stark simplicity of its designs and the audacious aesthetic boldness of many of its colorful <em>fumé</em> dials. Both specialties are in full view in the Pioneer Centre Seconds Concept Citrus Green, whose radiant lime-green dial might have been the most eye-catching of the entire fair. The “Concept” in the watch’s name denotes the stripped down nature of the dial, which has no markers, no numerals, not even the brand logo: just the Pioneer family’s signature leaf-shaped hands and a central seconds hand, with Super-LumiNova on the hands and inner flange. The stainless steel case measures 42.8mm and comes on a bright blue rubber strap that completes the model’s cheerfully colored ensemble. Inside the case is Moser’s in-house-manufactured Caliber HMC 201, with automatic winding and a three-day power reserve. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Nomos Tangente 38 Date - 175 Years Watchmaking Glashütte</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Nomos-Tangente-38-Date-175-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713384213"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">German affordable-luxury watchmaker Nomos Glashütte made its inaugural appearance at Watches &amp; Wonders in 2024, and its featured collection is all about color — 31 of them, to be exact. Each model in the “Nomos Tangente 38 Date - 175 Years Watchmaking Glashütte” series is a limited edition of 175 pieces, and each of the 31 individual models has its own distinctive colorway</span><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">. Among the rainbow of choices are the ‘70s-style “Sportbunt,” with a combo of light red main dial, dark red subdial, cream numerals, and turquoise and yellow outer rings; the hot-pink-and-magenta “Chili” edition on a gray textile strap; the forest-green and gray “Schlossgrun,” and the somber “Tiefseegrau,” (“deep sea gray”), matching dark anthracite with cream and dusty pink details. Each model’s stainless steel case measures 37.5mm in diameter and features an exhibition caseback with the watch’s engraved limited-edition number.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Rolex Perpetual 1908</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Perpetual-1908-2024-2_c44c6301-e2d7-4468-844a-54dd0922c758_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713384261"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Rolex has unveiled a new version of its Perpetual 1908 dress watch, which debuted last year, in a platinum case and an elegantly executed ice-blue dial with a guilloché rice-grain motif. The delicate, eye-catching geometrical pattern blossoms in the manner of a rosette on the surface of the dial, which also employs another type of hand-applied guilloché, a crimped, filet sauté pattern, for the minute track. Like the gold version that preceded it, the dial hosts distinctly stylish Arabic applied numerals at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock and faceted hands. The finely brushed and polished platinum case measures 39mm in diameter, with a coin-edge bezel and fluted lugs, and contains the self-winding Perpetual Caliber 1704, with a 66-hour power reserve. Also like its predecessor, it comes mounted on a dressy leather strap, here in matte brown with Rolex's double-folding "Dualclasp" in the same platinum as the case.</span></p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials Mastery</span></span></h4><h4><b>Panerai Submersible Luna Rossa</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Panerai-Submersible-LunaRossa-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713450028" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panerai’s partnership with the America’s Cup and the Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli team, which began in 2019, has yielded several special-edition timepieces as well as the integration of high-tech materials used in the sport of competitive sailing into Panerai’s watchmaking. Panerai incorporates the newest of these nautical-inspired materials, called Ti-Ceramitech, into its latest Submersible QuarantaQuattro Luna Rossa editions, which were unveiled at Panerai’s booth under the shadow of a ceiling-suspended racing boat. Ti-Ceramitech is derived from an Electrolytic Plasma Oxidation process of titanium ceramization (for which Panerai has filed a patent), which gives the surface of the material a particularly dense hardness while also remaining lightweight — 44 percent lighter than steel, to be specific, yet 10 times tougher than traditional ceramic. Panerai’s particular process uses a specific combination of base elements to achieve a distinctive blue coloring, which is echoed on the watch’s strap. The 44mm case, including the ratcheting bezel characteristic of the Submersible model, is forged from Ti-Ceramitech and measures 44mm in diameter. The dial is in either matte-grained white or sunbrushed blue; behind it beats the in-house Panerai Caliber P.900, with automatic winding and a three-day power reserve. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b>Montblanc 1858 Geosphere 0 Oxygen Carbo2</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Montblanc-Geoosphere-1858-Carbo-02-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713450071" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montblanc introduced its “zero oxygen” technology — in which a watch is constructed to be completely devoid of oxygen inside the case and crystal, thus eliminating fogging at high altitudes — in 2022, in a version of its exploration-oriented world-time watch, the Geosphere 1858. This year, the penmaker-turned-watchmaker takes it a step further with a case made of a pioneering material called CARBO2, which is formed from a process that captures carbon dioxide from biogas production and blends it with mineral waste from recycling factories to achieve an ultra-light, ultra-resistant composite material — in this instance, with a graphic, dark-shaded surface. Measuring 43.5mm and combining the CARBO2 case middle and bezel with a titanium caseback, the case has added on-theme visual bonuses: a silhouette of the Mont Blanc in luminous blue on its side and a photorealistic laser print of the mountain on its back. The dial, with the hallmark rotating Northern and Southern Hemisphere globes to track two time zones, features its own crystalline, glacier-pattern textured motif from a process called <em>“gratté-boisé.”</em> Montblanc’s automatic Caliber MB 29.25 beats inside the watch, which is (also on-theme) limited to 1,969 pieces in honor of the year Reinhold Messner ascended the north face of Mont Blanc solo. </span></p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh Faces on Familiar Favorites</span></b></span></h4><h4><b>Baume &amp; Mercier Clifton Moon Phase</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Baume-_-Mercier-Clifton-Moon-Phase-2_6c5dfb4c-b0ba-4a5c-bf5b-2a3a3ea9b2a4_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713455643"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baume &amp; Mercier’s elegant Clifton collection welcomed its the first moon-phase timepieces equipped with the Swiss brand’s in-house-made Baumatic caliber. The Baume &amp; Mercier Clifton Baumatic Moon Phase Date (Ref. M0A10756 with gradient blue lacquer dial and Ref. M0A10758 with a gradient gray lacquer dial) features the classical round Clifton case, which takes its inspiration from a vintage watch from the 1950s, in steel with an array of polished and brushed finishing and a comfortable diameter of 39mm. The lacquered dials have the series’ hallmark Alpha-shaped hour and minute hands and riveted trapezoid indexes, plus a large semicircular aperture at 6 o’clock dominated by the lunar complication and its accompanying analog date display. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the case ticks the Baumatic Caliber BM14-1975 ACI, the latest generation of the self-winding Baumatic movement that emerged in 2018, whose friction-resistant silicon parts help it to achieve a power reserve of 120 hours, or five full days, and a magnetic resistance to 1,500 Gauss.</span></p><h4><b>Oris Aquis Date</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Oris-Aquis-Date-2024-small-group-2_0f213dad-2a44-47f2-9d49-69d3b244b467_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713455760"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oris built its 2024 presentation around a subtle but substantial revamp of its flagship Aquis collection, specifically the core Aquis Date and its megapopular offshoot, the Oris Date Upcycle. The next-generation models are designed to be both more wearable and more stylish than its predecessors, with reworked lugs and crown protectors; the former have been given a more sculpted treatment that enables them to better hug the wrist, while the latter elements now taper toward the screw-down crown to better guard against accidental shocks and impacts. The steel bracelets’ brushed center links are now broader and more prominent and their overall form is more tapered; on the 43.5mm models containing Oris’ in-house Caliber 400, it’s also equipped with Oris’s Quick Adjust clasp system, which enables easy loosening or tightening of the fit without removing links. For the dials, Oris created new, polished, shield-shaped applied hour markers and a new set of Alpha-shaped hands, both coated with Super-LumiNova, as well as an entirely new, bespoke typography font. Purists will also appreciate the new date display, with high-contrast numerals on background colors that match the dial.</span></p><h4><b>Raymond Weil Millesime Tricomopax Chronograph</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Raymond-Weil-Millesime-Chronograph-blue-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713465256"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the “strike while the iron is hot” department: independent Geneva-based Raymond Weil, still basking in the glory of winning last year’s GPHG “Challenge Prize” for its vintage-styled Millesime Small Seconds model, has introduced 11 new references in the Millesime collection at its first-ever appearance at Watches &amp; Wonders. Among the new models are new dial-color options in the existing Small Seconds and Central Seconds 39mm families; a 35mm female-targeted model; a new version with a moon-phase display; and my favorite, a Tricompax Chronograph timepiece offered in two panda-dial iterations, one with a midnight blue dial and white counters, the other with the same-colored subdials on a black dial. Both versions have 39.5mm cases in stainless steel, with pump-style chrono pushers, and the distinctive dial typography and “sector”-oriented design elements that caught the attention of GPHG voters in its original version (you can read my review of that watch, and familiarize yourself with the Millesime’s aesthetic hallmarks, <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/raymond-weil-millesime-review">here</a>). Inside the case is the automatic, Sellita-based RW5030 movement, which stores an impressive 56 hours of power. </span></p><h4><b>Tudor Black Bay 58 GMT</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-GMT-flat-2_b0184071-db6d-4926-b7ba-46eea88cfe60_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713455940"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tudor has added a GMT model to its megapopular Black Bay 58 family, a series of vintage-styled dive watches that emerged from the core Black Bay collection and which has found favor among enthusiasts for its understated 39mm case diameter. The watch is essentially a smaller version of the Black Bay GMT that debuted in 2018, which takes its stylistic cues from Rolex’s iconic GMT-Master and adds brand-hallmark elements like a bicolor GMT bezel in indigo and burgundy. On the Black Bay 58 GMT, this 24-hour day-night bezel has a glossier finish for a more vibrant aesthetic; the dial’s “Snowflake” handset has added layers of Super-LumiNova for legibility, and the movement inside is the automatic Caliber MT5440-U, boasting both a COSC certification as well as a METAS certification as a “Master Chronometer; its power reserve is 65 hours, just shy of the 70 hours offered by the non-GMT-equipped base caliber. The Black Bay 58 GMT comes on either a sporty black rubber strap or the classic Tudor riveted steel bracelet.</span></p><h4><b>Ulysse Nardin Freak S Nomad</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Ulysse-Nardin-Freak-S-Nomad-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713456015"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Still freaky but now with a touch of high-horology elegance” is how I described the Ulysse Nardin Freak S Nomad in a post-Watches &amp; Wonders Instagram post, and I’m sticking with the description. The watch, a limited edition of 99 pieces, builds on 2022’s Freak S design, which introduced the first automatic movement with an inclined double oscillator regulated by a differential and also incorporated Ulysse Nardin’s unconditional Grinder winding system. (For a greater understanding of how the Freak works — and how to read the time on it — check out my </span><a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/ulysse-nardin-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-depth article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Ulysse Nardin.) The “Nomad” version uses an “experimental mix” of materials for the 45mm case, including titanium for the middle, anthracite-PVD titanium for the bezel and carbon fiber for the flanks. The rotating hour disk in the Freak S’ spaceship-inspired, flying-carousel time-display system is here enhanced with a diamond guilloché finish, produced entirely by hand, with no electronic or laser guidance, by a single artisan on an 18th-century rose engine. The disk — it can’t really be called a “dial” — is made in one continuous motion, meaning no two are exactly alike; the sand-colored surface, evoking a desert, lends the watch its wayfaring name, Nomad. The dynamic tableau on the front face is courtesy of the in-house movement, Caliber UN-25.</span></p><h4><b>Vacheron Constantin Overseas Self-winding Green</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-Overseas-green-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713456117"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have heard that Vacheron Constantin unveiled the new World’s Most Complicated Timepiece at Watches &amp; Wonders this year, an accomplishment deserving of much deeper coverage elsewhere rather than a blurb on this list. On the (slightly) more attainable level, the centuries-old Swiss <i>manufacture</i> rolled out the first models in its sport-luxury Overseas collection with “intense” green dials, notable for their combination of sunburst satin-finished centers and velvet-finished flanges. The new series consists of Self-winding models in two sizes (41mm version pictured above), as well as Chronograph and Dual Time versions. All feature the emblematic look of the Overseas, including the six-sided bezel evocative of Vacheron’s Maltese Cross emblem, a motif that continues onto the links of the integrated bracelet. Rose gold is used for the cases, hands, and markers. Vacheron’s in-house movement (Caliber 5100 in the Automatic model) beats inside, amassing a 40-hour power reserve and bearing the Geneva Hallmark certification for accuracy and high-horology decorative mastery, including the openworked 22k gold rotor with the Overseas collection’s compass rose symbol. Like all contemporary Overseas models, the new models offer Vacheron’s proprietary quick-change system that allows the wearer to swap the bracelet for a rubber strap without tools.</span></p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">History Revisited</span></span></h4><h4><b>Angelus Instrument de Vitesse Limited Edition</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Angelus-Instrument-de-Vitesse-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713457815"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever wondered why anyone timing quick bursts of speed, like laps in an automobile race, needs a stopwatch that can accumulate times up to 12 hours, Angelus may have created your ideal timepiece. The historic brand pays homage to the golden age of motorsport, and strips the chronograph watch down to its original, bare-essential purpose, with the release of the Instrument de Vitesse, a set of two 25-piece limited editions in the historically inspired La Fabrique series. At first glance, the watch, in a slender 39mm case with ebony-black or ivory white dial, looks like a simple three-hander, but a closer look reveals the tachymeter scale around the periphery and the classical monopusher embedded in the crown; the latter activates the single chronograph hand in the center, which can be started, stopped and returned to zero by the same button to record elapsed times to a maximum of 60 seconds — perfect for taking average speed readings of fast-moving targets like race cars. The movement inside, Angelus Caliber A5000, is suitably old-school, with manual winding, a steady 3Hz frequency, and an integrated chronograph device with a column wheel and vertical clutch, and the dial, with its historical typography, would be at home on the dashboard of a classic car.</span></p><h4><b>Cartier Privé Collection Tortue Monopoussoir</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Cartier-Prive-Tortue-Monopoussoir-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713541682" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like its predecessors in the exclusive, vintage-revival Cartier Privé collection, inaugurated in 2017, the Tortue Monopoussoir, a limited edition of 200 pieces, takes its cues from one of the watchmaker-jeweler’s classical, historic shaped timepieces — in this case, the Tortue (French for “turtle”), first created in 1912 as one of Cartier’s earliest models, after the Santos-Dumont (1904) and before the Tank (1917). The specific inspiration for the piece, however, arrived in 1928, as the first Tortue equipped with a monopusher chronograph, and was revived with some modern updates in 1998. Several of those updates are evident on the new watch, including the “apple”-shaped hands in blued steel, the hollowed-out central seconds hand, and triangular motifs in the dial’s corners. The two-register dial with elegant Roman numerals is bordered by a railway minute track, and the crown on the 43.7mm x 34.8mm turtle-shaped case (in gold or platinum) is fitted with a monopusher to activate the chronograph’s start, stop, and reset functions. Powering these functions is the manually winding, exquisitely decorated Caliber 1928 MC, situated behind a sapphire caseback that spotlights the motion of the gear train, column wheel, and Geneva-wave-finished, beveled bridges.</span></p><h4><b>Parmigiani Toric Small Seconds</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Parmigiani-Toric-Small-Seconds-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713466430"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toric was the first wristwatch model created by Parmigiani Fleurier’s eponymous founder, Michel Parmigiani, back in 1996 at the brand’s inception. While aspects of the Toric — particularly its architecturally derived, Golden Mean-influenced proportions and fluted bezels echoing the look of ancient Roman columns — have been adopted by other product families in the collection, it has been quite a while since we’ve seen new versions of the Toric itself. For its relaunch in 2024, Parmigiani established some bold and very narrow parameters: all the watches will have in-house, manually winding movements; said movements will all use gold for their major parts, like the bridges and mainplates; the cases will only be made of gold or platinum, and even the dials and their hands and indexes will be crafted in gold. Perhaps just as boldly, Parmigiani says that Toric dials, all with a grained and beveled finish, will eschew the increasingly bright and audacious colorways of many of today’s popular timepieces in favor of a more understated, pastel palette that is “drawn from the chromatic universe of [Swiss architect] Le Corbusier,” of whose iconic work Michel Parmigiani has long been an admirer. Two versions were unveiled at Watches &amp; Wonders, a sublimely simple Small Seconds model and the more complicated Chronograph Rattrapante. The straps (no bracelets), in Nubuck leather with a sartorial stitching technique perfected by Neapolitan tailors, carry forth the color scheme of the dials and fasten to the wrist with pin buckles made from the same precious metal as the case. </span></p><h4><b>Zenith Defy Extreme Diver</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Extreme-Diver-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713457886"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zenith surprised many with the launch of its first divers’ watch in decades, the Defy Extreme Diver, alongside a special, period-appropriate Revival Edition of the 1969 model that provides its template (covered in detail <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watches-wonders-2024-zenith-defy-revival-a3648-brings-divers-back-to-the-collection">here</a>). In many respects, the Zenith Extreme Diver is unmistakably a member of the modern Defy family, with its hallmark angular case (42mm in titanium) and dodecagonal bezel, but it also evokes its predecessor with its orange-detailed dial and “extreme” 600-meter water resistance, evidenced by the built-in helium-release valve — an impressive feat when its ancestor achieved it in 1969 and still a rarity in dive watches today. (Six hundred meters, incidentally, is equivalent to 1,969 feet, making for a utilitarian tribute to the Defy collection’s debut year.)  The dial, which color-matches the ceramic dive-scale bezel insert, has an engraved geometric motif of four-pointed stars and a sunburst finish that emanates from the Zenith star emblem at 12 o’clock. The hands and hour markers feature no less than three distinct pigments of X1 Super-LumiNova — blue, green, and orange — for optimum legibility in the dark or deep underwater.</span></p><h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horological Milestones</span></span></h4><h4><strong>A.

Lange &amp; Söhne will find a lot to love about the new Datograph Perpetual Tourbillon Honeygold Lumen, a limited edition of 50 pieces that commemorates 25 years since the launch of Lange’s first Datograph timepiece in 1999. Like its most recent predecessor in 2016, the high-complication watch marries three of the Saxon </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signature mechanisms — a flyback chronograph with a precisely jumping minutes counter; Lange’s hallmark “outsize” date display; a perpetual calendar with an ultra-precise moon-phase (deviating by a single day only once after 122.6 years) and with all indications controlled by a single rapid-adjustment button; and a one-minute-rotating tourbillon inside a filigreed cage, equipped with the world-first stop-seconds mechanism that Lange introduced in 2008, enabling the tourbillon to be stopped for precise setting of the movement. What’s new on this model are two additional elements that are exclusive to the brand and historically used to denote a very special edition: one is the use of Lange’s proprietary Honey Gold alloy for the 41.5mm case; the other is the “Lumen” treatment of the dial and its various displays, in which the movement, the in-house-made Caliber L952.4, is visible behind a semitransparent dial coated with a luminous compound — the same compound used in varying degrees of thickness on the hands, tachymeter-scale dial ring, date disks, moon-phase, and subdials. The darker the watch’s surroundings, the more radiant the ghostly green glow that it emits.</span></p><h4><b>IWC Portugieser Eternal Calendar</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portugieser-Eternal-Calendar-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713470424"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IWC refreshed its venerable Portugieser collection for 2024 and its high-complication centerpiece is one of the indisputable stars of this year’s Watches &amp; Wonders. The Portugieser Eternal Calendar, explored in much more detail <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/iwc-watches-wonders-2025">here,</a> is the first timepiece whose calendar, leap years and all, will be precise for 400 years without corrections, and whose moon-phase display will remain accurate for an astonishing 45 million years. The watch’s most notable innovation is the newly developed “400 years gear,” which is designed to skip automatically over the years 2100, 2200, and 2300 — which would normally appear in the indication as leap years but are actually “common years,” according to the solar calendar — ensuring that the watch’s date won’t require a correction until the year 3999. The watch’s even more “eternal” feature is the moon-phase, equipped with a new “reduction gear train,” with three wheels and a specially developed tooth profile that can simulate many trillions of moon-phase scenarios occurring in the natural lunar cycle, thus ensuring that the display will deviate from the moon’s actual orbit only once in an astounding 45 million years. All of this cosmic complexity comes delivered in a very handsome and surprisingly compact package, with a 44.5mm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> case made of platinum and a frosted lacquer dial.</span></p><h4><strong>Jaeger-LeCoultre Duomètre Heliotourbillon Perpetual</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Jaeger-LeCoultre-Heliotourbillon-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713540156" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Watchmaker of Watchmakers” Jaeger-LeCoultre earned its historical sobriquet with this year’s horological chef d’oeuvre, the Duomètre Heliotourbillon Perpetual, whose signature innovation is the dynamic, world-first triple-axis tourbillon that spins like a top in an large aperture on the left side of the case. This visually arresting device, however, is only one of an array of technical marvels incorporated into the new in-house movement, manually wound Caliber 388. The “Duomètre” in the timepiece’s name refers to Jaeger-LeCoultre’s patented mechanism, introduced in 2007, that uses two separate barrels and gear trains, linked to a single regulator, to independently power the timekeeping and the additional complications, thus ensuring accuracy and less of a drain on the power supply. The “Heliotourbillon” is the aforementioned device, rotating on a cylindrical hairspring on three axes with three titanium cages: the first, set at a 90-degree angle to the balance wheel; the second, at 90 degrees to the first, both making a full rotation in 30 seconds; and the third, perpendicular to the second, making a full rotation in 60 seconds, all mounted on ceramic ball bearings to minimize friction. “Perpetual,” of course, denotes the perpetual calendar mechanism, which includes a Grade Date display, a super-accurate moon-phase, a patented leap year indication in red, and another world-first technical breakthrough: it’s the first perpetual calendar in which the hour and minute can be set backwards or forwards without doing damage to the synchrony of the calendar settings. Jaeger-LeCoultre packs all of this micromechanical wizardry into a 34-part rose-gold case measuring 44mm; as you’d expect, its rarity and exclusivity is baked into the production run: just 20 pieces will be made.</span></p><h4><b>Patek Philippe World Time Reference 5330G-001</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-5330G-WorldTime-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713472130"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>With the latest version of its iconic world-time watch, based on the very first one from the 1950s, Patek Philippe has proven once again that it doesn’t just make watches with high complications — it makes high complications that improve upon even the highest of existing complications. The latest edition, Ref. 5330G-001, addresses the persistent problem that has always been ingrained in even the most sophisticated world-timers: namely, that the wearer needed to adjust the date on such a watch (which corresponds with the local time selected, on both the hands and at 12 o’clock on the 24-city ring) whenever traveling to a new time zone after midnight or traveling west to east across the International Date Line. In the former situation, the date would need to advance forward by one; in the latter case, it needs to be moved back by one. Thanks to an ingenious, patented mechanism built into Patek’s new <i>manufacture</i> Caliber 240 HU C, which combines two concentric, star-shaped gear wheels with a differential system, pressing once on the 10 o’clock pusher adjusts not only the city disk, 24-hour disk and central hour hand, but also (when necessary) the date hand, in either direction, with no extra manual date correction needed. The indication of the date itself is a first for Patek Philippe, via a transparent glass hand with a red-lacquered hammer tip pointing to a transfer-printed 1-31 scale on the flange, which surrounds an opaline blue-gray dial center with an eye-catching carbon motif. It’s all housed in a relatively understated 40mm case in white gold, mounted on a handsome (albeit somewhat un-Patek-like) denim-motif calfskin strap.</span></p><h4><b>Piaget Altiplano Ultimate Concept Tourbillon</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Piaget-Altiplano-Ultimate-Tourbillon-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713551395" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As history-minded watch aficionados know, Piaget has a long history of making ultra-thin watches, starting with the revolutionary Caliber 9P in 1957 and continuing to set records in the category all the way up to 2018 with the Altiplano Ultimate Concept, the world’s thinnest wristwatch at the time. For its 150th anniversary in 2024, Piaget went all-out in challenging the frontiers of horological slimness with the release of its latest record-breaker, the Piaget Ultimate Concept Tourbillon, which somehow manages to incorporate a flying tourbillon cage into a waiflike 2mm-thick case. Yes, at least as of this writing, that is the world’s thinnest tourbillon watch (ball’s back in your court, Bulgari). How Piaget accomplished this feat is a three-year R&amp;D journey that’s too complex to detail here, but essentially its watchmakers had to redesign the 2018 watch (which had no tourbillon) almost from the ground up. Like its predecessor, the new watch basically saves space by using the caseback as the movement mainplate and setting the crown flush into the caseband to be operated by a stylus. The material used for the case, measuring 41.5mm, is blue-PVD-treated cobalt, which offers the best thinness to hardness ratio. The tourbillon, made chiefly of titanium, is designed so it is anchored in place by its own perimeter via ceramic ball bearings; ball bearings also replace pivots in the mainspring system, reducing friction while still managing a power reserve of 40 hours when fully wound. The entire case (with a balance-wheel rim and a sapphire crystal both measuring a minuscule 2 microns) is only about as thick as a coin, and, according to Piaget, “made to be worn.”</span></p><h4><b>TAG Heuer Monaco Split-Seconds Chronograph</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/TAG-Heuer-Monaco-Split-Seconds-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713549035" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Watches &amp; Wonders kicked off, TAG Heuer was not a brand that most of us would have expected to see in this category, but its show-stopping Monaco Split-Seconds Chronograph proved to be undeniably one of the horological highlights of the show. Commemorating 55 years since the launch of the original Monaco in 1969, the new timepiece achieves an elite level of chronograph complication with its all-new movement, Caliber TH81-00, developed in a partnership between TAG Heuer and the specialists at Vaucher, which boasts the rare and exotic split-seconds function (aka a “rattrapante”), enabling the wearer to measure two concurrent timing events independently. For the first time, the Monaco, named for a famous Grand Prix race and famously worn by racing drivers of the 1970s, is capable of timing multiple laps on a racetrack in quick succession. The avant-garde elements don’t end with the mechanism: the famous square case is made of lightweight titanium, framing a sapphire dial that affords a view of the movement from the front, whose blued, arching bridges have a gradient surface achieved through an anodizing process. The 9 o’clock rattrapante pusher is made of colored titanium and matches the color of the split-seconds hand for an additional dash of color. Finally, in a first for the brand, the entire caseback is made from sapphire for an unobstructed view of the complex movement — the first, TAG Heuer says, in a renewed commitment to exploring high complications in future special editions. </span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">There are dive watches that you wear to go diving and there are dive watches that you wear — well, maybe afterward, to the country club where you go to talk about diving. It is this latter category that we’re focusing on with this list — so-called “luxury” dive watches, timepieces that still offer all the functionality and toughness one requires of a diver (all of the watches listed come in at 200 meters or more of water resistance) but do so at a higher level of elegance than elevates them from tool watch to dress watch — i.e., precious metal or exotic-material cases, extra complications, exclusive designs, artisanal executions, or a combination of the above, all of which account for their accordingly lofty price points. Here are a dozen that qualify.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Diver</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Audemars-Piguet-Royal-Oak-Offshore-Diver-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713291628" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $30,500, Case Size: 42mm, Thickness: 14.2mm, Water Resistance: 300m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Audemars Piguet Caliber 4308</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audemars Piguet added a purpose-built dive watch to its Royal Oak Offshore collection of boldly styled sport-luxury timepieces — which spun out of the original, classic Royal Oak series — in 2010. The Royal Oak Offshore Divers feature 42mm cases that are integrated not into metal bracelets (like those of the core Royal Oak models) but into sleek, sporty rubber straps suited for underwater submergence. The cases are water-resistant to 300 meters and the dials, with the hallmark “Mega Tapisserie” textured motif, host a pair of wide luminous hands, blocky luminous indexes, and a date display under a magnifying lens. An inner rotating dive-scale bezel occupies the flange, operable through an extra screw-down crown at 10 o’clock, which enables the watch to retain the stationary, octagonal bezel that epitomizes the Royal Oak collection while still making it functional for diving. The movement inside is the in-house, self-winding Caliber AP 4308, endowed with a 60-hour power reserve. The Royal Oak Offshore Diver are predominantly in stainless steel, but their elite finishing, elaborately decorated movements, and collector appeal elevate them easily into the luxury echelon.</span></p><h4><b>Bell &amp; Ross BR 03-92 Diver Black &amp; Green Bronze</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Bell-_-Ross-BR03-92-Diver-Bronze-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713293977"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $4,900, Case Size: 42mm, Thickness: 12mm, Lug Width: 24mm, Water Resistance: 300m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Caliber BR-CAL.302</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell &amp; Ross is no stranger to bringing tool-oriented design into the realm of luxury; its flagship Instrument collection started as an homage to aircraft dashboard clocks. The brand launched its first divers’ watch, the round-cased Hydromax, in 1997, followed it up with the tonneau-cased BR-02 in 2007, and finally, in 2017, unveiled the BR 03-92, the first dive watch in the square-cased “Instrument” shape for which the brand has become renowned. Introduced in 2024, this version of the BR 03-92 Diver combines a case made of bronze, a material traditionally associated with nautical equipment, with a brilliant green dial. Like its predecessors, the watch’s squared ergonomic case measures 42 mm in diameter and resists water pressure to 300 meters. Its 60-minute unidirectional bezel features a luminescent dot at 12 o’clock for orientation and its crown is protected by an impact-resistant guard, fitted with a rubber insert for easy handling. The sapphire crystal and the solid caseback are both extra-thick and an inner cage made of soft iron inside the case protects the movement — the automatic BR-Cal.302, based on the Sellita SW 300.1 — from the effects of magnetic fields.</span></p><h4><b>Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Automatique 42 Rose Gold</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Blancpain-Fifty-Fathoms-Automatique-42-RG-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713285154"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $34,300, Case Size: 42.3mm, Thickness: 14.2mm, Lug Width: 21.5mm, Water Resistance: 300m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Blancpain Caliber 1315</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Released in 1953, the Blancpain Fifty Fathoms is in many respects the granddaddy of all modern divers’ watches, as it was the first one equipped with the now-ubiquitous, locking unidirectional bezel to set dive times as well as establishing new standards for depth and magnetism resistance. The modern, “Automatique” version of the Fifty Fathoms has long been sized at a rather imposing 45mm, but in 2023, for the model’s 70th anniversary, Blancpain rolled out new Automatiques at the Fifty Fathoms’ original 42mm size, with cases made of rose gold or grade 23 titanium. The blue or black dial retains the classic look of the trendsetting 1953 vintage model, and the movement inside, made in-house by Blancpain, is the self-winding Caliber 1315, which stores a five-day power reserve in its three barrels and features a host of high-horology decorations that the wearer can glimpse through a sapphire caseback. Undeniably elegant and historic, the Fifty Fathoms Automatique is also even more robustly built than its ancestor, which was originally meant for military divers: the case maintains 300 meters of water resistance, which is much more than 50 fathoms.</span></p><h4><b>Breitling Superocean Automatic 42 Rose Gold</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Breitling-Superocean-RG-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713281362"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $22,400, Case Size: 42mm, Thickness: 12.5mm, Lug-to-Lug: 47.7mm, Lug Width: 22mm, Water Resistance: 300m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Breitling Caliber 17</span></i></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Breitling’s Superocean dive watch received a vintage-inspired update in 2022, with a design hearkening back to the rare and mostly forgotten “Slow Motion” models of the 1960s, notable for their 60-minute central chronograph hand. On the new models, this central hand, which rotated around the dial only once per hour rather than once per minute, has given way to a more conventional running seconds hand with a circular tip that pays a subtle tribute to the  6 o’clock “dot” on the dials of the 1960s and ‘70s models. The large, luminous square of the historical watch’s “slow motion” hand now finds a home on the main minutes hand, paired with a wide sword hour hand. The chunky square indexes, also a nod to the vintage models, are luminous-coated for optimum legibility. The dive-scale inserts on the bezels are made from scratch-proof ceramic. Intended for lifestyle situations as well as underwater sport, the new Superocean comes in a variety of executions and case materials including one that uses 18k rose gold for the case, crown and buckle.</span></p><h4><b>Glashütte Original Spezialist SeaQ Red Gold</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Glashuette-Original-SeaQ-RG-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713281573"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $23,400, Case Size: 39.5mm, Thickness: 12.15mm, Water Resistance: 200m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Glashütte Original Caliber 39-11</span></i></p><p data-mce-fragment="1">The SeaQ dive watch hails from Glashütte Original’s Spezialist collection of sport-luxury timepieces inspired by the Spezimatic Type RP TS 200, a watch developed by the German brand’s Cold War-era predecessor, the state-owned GUB, for recreational divers and released in 1969. Its round case, here in brushed and polished rose gold, measures 39.5 mm in diameter, and the unidirectional dive-scale bezel includes a black ceramic insert to match the black dial, with its distinctive luminous handset and date window at 3 o’clock. Like its brethren in the Spezialist collection, the SeaQ meets the (German) DIN 8306 and (international) ISO 6425 standards for dive watches, and its solid engraved caseback protects the in-house Glashütte Original Caliber 39-11, with its 40-hour power reserve, from water pressures down to 200 meters. The watch is mounted on a black rubber strap that can be switched out with a gray NATO textile strap.</p><h4><b>Grand Seiko Evolution 9 Spring Drive 5 Day Divers 200M “Ushio”</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-Spring-Drive-Diver-2_350bcc7a-fba7-46fb-b012-e73a5a5233f8_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713281873" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $11,600, Case Size: 43.8mm, Thickness: 13.8mm, Lug Width: 23mm, Water Resistance: 200m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Spring Drive Caliber 9RA5</span></i></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following up Grand Seiko’s 2022 launch of its Evolution 9 collection, which takes inspiration from a trend-setting model from 1967, the Japanese </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released a new, luxuriously appointed divers’ watch with an entirely new dial texture in 2023. The Ref. SLGA203 “Ushio” (from the Japanese word for “tide”) is distinguished by its 43.8mm case made of high-intensity titanium, its blue rotating divers’ bezel made of ceramic, and by the cascading-waves dial texture that lends it its name, which visually references the ocean currents in the coastal waters of Japan. The prominent hands and markers are all coated in Lumibrite, helping to maintain legibility deep underwater, to a depth of 200 meters. The case holds the recently introduced Spring Drive Caliber 9R05 with five full days of power reserve, a 60 percent increase from that of its predecessor, Caliber 9R6. The 120-hour power reserve is stored in two barrels of different sizes, better for torque and for optimizing the use of space. Caliber 9RA5 is the first Spring Drive movement equipped with a sensor to monitor its internal temperature and to compensate for any related changes in the crystal’s oscillation rate: now, that’s luxury</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p><h4><b>Jaeger-LeCoultre Polaris Mariner Memovox</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/JLC-Polaris-Mariner-Memovox-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713283105" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $20,600, Case Size: 42mm, Thickness: 15.63mm, Water Resistance: 300m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Breguet Caliber 582QA</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaeger-LeCoultre introduced the original Memovox Polaris in 1968 as the first diver’s watch outfitted with a mechanical alarm function. The <em>maison</em> revived the Polaris name, and the 1968 dual-crown, sector-dial design of the original watch, for its sportiest collection in 2018, and followed up with the streamlined, even more robustly built Mariner subfamily in 2020. The Mariner Memovox is the model that most closely resembles the vintage model (the collection also includes chronographs, three-hands, and world timers): its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">triple-crown-operated mechanical alarm function, in the modern Caliber 956, is a direct descendant of Jaeger-LeCoultre’s first self-winding alarm movement, with three crowns to control the alarm function and time setting. The first crown winds the alarm and then sets the alarm and date when it’s pulled out; the middle crown adjusts the bidirectional inner rotating bezel for dive times; and the lower crown pulls out to adjust the time on the hour and minute hands. The alarm is built to be heard underwater, even if the owner is more likely to use it to remind him of an appointment or the start of Happy Hour.</span></p><h4><b>Omega Seamaster Diver 300M “007 Edition” Master Chronometer</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Omega-Seamaster-Diver-007-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713283276" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $8,900, Case Size: 42mm, Thickness: 13mm, Lug-to-Lug: 49.6mm, Lug Width: 20mm, Water Resistance: 300m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Omega Caliber 8806</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What screams “luxury” louder than a watch worn by the world’s most stylish superspy, James Bond? This Omega Seamaster Diver 300M “007 Edition” bears the design input of Daniel Craig himself, who wore the watch as Bond in 2022’s “No Time to Die.” It features a 42mm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">titanium case, a scalloped-edge rotating divers’ bezel with an aluminum insert, an automatic helium release valve, and a brown “tropical” dial with vintage-hued lume and a British armed-forces-inspired “broad arrow” marking above 6 o’clock — a reference to Bond’s backstory as a naval officer. The case’s 300-meter water resistance is aided by a screw-down crown. Equipped with Omega’s Master Chronometer Caliber 8806, the model comes on either a NATO strap or a steel mesh bracelet, ensuring it can be worn with either a dinner jacket or a dive suit.</span></p><h4><b>Panerai Submersible QuarantaQuattro Carbotech Blu Abisso</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Panerai-Submersible-Carbotech-2_41520413-cd8a-4f67-8205-48f521a6c65c_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713295944" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $18,600, Case Size: 44mm, Lug Width: 24mm, Water Resistance: 300m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Panerai Caliber P.900</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once regarded solely as a purveyor of huge, chunky watches with a rugged retro-military charm, Panerai has widened the scope of its offerings to appeal to more consumers with a variety of tastes and wrist sizes. The Submersible QuarantaQuattro models are the latest nod to the trend, with 44mm case sizes that occupy the midrange between the massive 47mm diameter of the first-generation Submersible and the reduced 42mm of subsequent models. Retaining the model’s hallmark, patented crown-protecting bridge device as well as its professional-grade 300-meter water resistance, the stealth-stylish QuarantaQuattro Carbotech Blu Abisso joined the lineup in 2022. Its case is made of <a href="https://www.panerai.com/us/en/home/focus/carbotech.html">Carbotech</a>, an ultra-lightweight, corrosion-resistant material constructed of carbon fibers developed by Panerai. The black textured case’s unidirectional divers’ bezel frames the deep blue dial. Panerai’s in-house automatic Caliber P.900 ticks inside, driving the hours, minutes, small seconds at 9 o’clock, and date indication at 3 o’clock, and stores in its single barrel a power reserve of three days. Harmonizing with the <i>Blu Abisso</i> dial is a sturdy blue rubber strap with a trapezoidal buckle made of DLC-coated titanium that echoes the black tones of the case.</span></p><h4><b>Rolex Oyster Perpetual Deepsea Yellow Gold</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Deepsea-2024-2_0dc848b7-585b-47f5-bd8a-52e46244ca6e_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713292861" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $52,100, Case Size: 44mm, Water Resistance: 3,900m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Rolex Caliber 3235</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolex tripled down on the remarkable water-resistance of its Sea-Dweller dive watch (itself a more robust extension of the original, iconic Submariner from 1953) with the first Sea-Dweller Deepsea in 2008, a titanium-cased watch that measured a hefty 44mm in diameter and boasted an unheard-of depth rating of 3,990 meters, or 12,800 feet. At Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva 2024, Rolex introduced the Deepsea (now separate from the Sea-Dweller and positioned as the third and most extreme of Rolex’s triumvirate of dive watches) for the first time in a case and bracelet made fully of yellow gold. Technically, the case combines a middle section in gold, a rotating Cerachrom bezel in blue ceramic with yellow-gold PVD numerals, and a hermetically sealed caseback made of titanium. The case features an automatic helium release valve for saturation diving and an extra-thick crystal (5.5mm) to withstand the crushing depths at which the watch is built to function. The blue lacquered dial has the familiar luminous Mercedes handset and shaped hour markers established way back in the 1950s by the Submariner, here with the inscription “Deepsea” in a contrasting gold powder. The ceramic-based Ringlock system securely protects the movement, Rolex’s automatic Caliber 3235.</span></p><h4><b>Tudor Black Bay 58 18K</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-18K-gold-2_a117a355-32e9-494b-b633-eb5286df0355_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713283368" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $32,000, Case Size: 39mm, Thickness: 12.7mm, Water Resistance: 200m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Tudor Caliber MT5400</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tudor released the Black Bay 58, an evolution of its core Black Bay series, in 2018 in response to consumer demand for smaller case sizes and greater vintage authenticity. Named for the year 1958 — in which its historical influencer, the Tudor Oyster Prince Submariner Ref. 7924, debuted — the Black Bay 58 series has spawned several high-end executions that stand above most of the Black Bay line in terms of elegance and exclusivity. The latest is the Black Bay 58 18K, the first model in full yellow gold. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the 39mm case and the bracelet feature a predominantly satin-brushed finish for a luxurious yet non-flashy presentation. The “golden green” of the dial, with matte-gold details like the familiar geometric indexes and “Snowflake” hands, is a shade specially chosen to resonate harmoniously with the case and the matte-green bezel, made of anodized aluminum. The bracelet, which is minus the retro-style rivets of its steel predecessors, has Tudor’s “T-fit” clasp for easy lengthening and a comfortable closure. The movement inside is the COSC-certified automatic MT5400, with bidirectional winding and a 70-hour power reserve.</span></p><h4><b>Ulysse Nardin Diver X Skeleton 44mm</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Ulysse-Nardin-Diver-X-Skeleton-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1713283647" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price: $27,000, Case Size: 44mm, Thickness: 16mm, Water Resistance: 200m, Crystal: Sapphire, Movement: Automatic Caliber UN-372</span></i></p><p>Ulysse Nardin has a unique heritage that blends a historical connection to seafaring, as maker of marine chronometers for the world’s navies in the 19th and 20th centuries, and a modern devotion to avant-garde horological innovation, the latter as exemplified by the brand’s iconoclastic Freak models. Both disciplines come together in the Diver X Skeleton, here in a titanium case, with white rubber for its diving-bezel insert and its strap, and a dial-side view of the self-winding, openworked UN-372 caliber. Ulysse Nardin makes other high-end dive watches, particularly in its Marine collection, but this model’s exceedingly rare marriage of dive watch and skeleton watch earns it a spot on this list of notables. The “X” that dominates the skeleton dial has a tiered construction that allows it to anchor the hands and hour markers, which appear to float above the technical depths of the dial. As with most Ulysse Nardin movements, Caliber UN-372 is loaded with silicon parts for greater magnetic resistance and a substantial power reserve — in this case, a full 96 hours.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever wondered what the “Wonders” were at the Watches &amp; Wonders fair (“Isn’t it really all just watches?”), IWC may have come up with an invention that most would agree is truly wondrous (and yes, it is inside of a watch, but still…) — namely, the IWC Portugieser Eternal Calendar, the high-complication flagship of the revamped Portugieser collection that was unveiled at the Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva exhibition this week.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portugieser-Eternal-Calendar-side-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712909558" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Most watch enthusiasts know IWC Schaffhausen best for its Pilot watches, which are among the most iconic and influential in horological history. What the most studious of these aficionados also recognize, however, is the Swiss brand’s prestigious place in the annals of complicated calendar timepieces, which was secured as early as 1985 with the groundbreaking Da Vinci Perpetual Calendar. At Watches &amp; Wonders 2024, as the high-complication centerpiece of its refreshed Portugieser collection, IWC has achieved the latest milestone in the category, unveiling the aptly named Portugieser Eternal Calendar, the first timepiece whose calendar, leap years and all, will be precise for 400 years without corrections, and whose moon-phase display will remain accurate for an astonishing 45 million years. </span></p><div data-mce-fragment="1" style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><img data-mce-fragment="1" style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portugieser-Eternal-Calendar-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712909726" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portugieser-Eternal-Calendar-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712909726" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">How does the Portugieser Eternal Calendar — which fits all of this near-cosmic level of complexity into a 44.5mm platinum case — accomplish these feats? It starts out with a standard Gregorian perpetual calendar, which accounts for the differing lengths of months and mechanically adds a leap-year day at the end of February every four years. While this is undeniably an impressive mechanical feat, the actual solar year is not evenly divided into 12 months or 24-hour days. Centurial years that are divisible by 400 — like 2000 and 2400 — are leap years while all others, including the upcoming years 2100, 2200, and 2300, are considered “common” years. A perpetual calendar can only be programmed for a four-year cycle (three common years followed by one leap year), and thus the first manual correction to the calendar indications will need to occur in 2100, the first of three corrections over 400 years. IWC’s ingenious invention to deal with this flaw is a newly developed “400 years” gear, which automatically skips three leap years over four centuries, ensuring that the calendar functions are correct until at least the year 3999. This gear, comprising only eight parts, includes three indentations that inform the calendar mechanism which leap years to skip.</span></p><div data-mce-fragment="1" style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><img data-mce-fragment="1" style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portugieser-Eternal-Calendar-caliber-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712910208" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portugieser-Eternal-Calendar-caliber-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712910208" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div><br data-mce-fragment="1"><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">If the owner of the Portugieser Eternal Calendar can rest assured that many generations of descendants may never have to worry about setting the date on their inherited timepiece, said owner might also wonder exactly what the planet will look like next time a moon-phase correction is needed. The even more “Eternal” function of the watch is the moon-phase, which is even more precise than the one IWC created for a previous Portugieser perpetual calendar timepiece back in 2003, which offered an unprecedented ongoing accuracy of 577.5 years. The challenge in making a truly accurate moon-phase mechanism lies in the reality that one lunation, from new moon to new moon, does not fit snugly into a 30- or 31-day cycle: it is actually 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.88 seconds. IWC addresses this with its “reduction gear train” between the base movement and the moon-phase disk; the mechanism uses three intermediate wheels whose proportions and specified number of teeth are able to simulate the more than 22 trillion different lunar scenarios that IWC’s engineers came up with in computer simulations. Mathematically, this means that once properly set, the moon-phase display — in IWC’s hallmark “Double Moon” configuration, which shows the moon as viewed from both Northern and Southern Hemispheres — will deviate from Luna’s actual orbit only by one day after 45 million years.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/IWC-Portugieser-Eternal-Calendar-dialCU-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712910415" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1">The movement responsible for all of these wonders is the newly developed Caliber IW52640, which can be glimpsed through an intricately crafted glass dial, with an underside frosted and lacquered in white, with separately machined and polished subdials and hand-applied indexes. A white lacquered flange with the emblematic Portugieser minute scale — yes, this watch still tells the current time in addition to, in IWC’s breathless words, “touching the limits of eternity” — sits between the glass dial and the box-shaped sapphire crystal. The movement features the brand’s proprietary Pellaton winding system and stores a power reserve of 168 hours in two barrels, which means once-a-week winding should be enough to keep the timepiece chugging along reliably for centuries to come.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Watches &amp; Wonders, the world’s biggest international watch fair, is taking place this week in Geneva, and our team is still visiting and meeting with some of the world’s most prestigious watchmakers. Today, we’re spotlighting Patek Philippe’s latest version of its historic Golden Ellipse dress watch, one of the new timepieces generating buzz in the halls of the expo.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Golden-Ellipse-2024-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712823917"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Golden Ellipse, launched in 1968, is Patek Philippe’s second oldest existing model behind the Calatrava. Its odd elliptical case, combining elements of an oval and a rectangle, took its influence from the “golden mean” of ancient Greek mathematicians and the basis of numerous artistic and architectural masterpieces throughout history. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The original model had a shimmering blue-and-gold dial and a manually wound movement, and gave rise to an entire collection of Golden Ellipses that by the late 1970s was comprised of 65 different references — even including a Golden Ellipse version of Patek’s sport-luxury Nautilus model. The collection’s first self-winding movements began appearing in 1977, with the debut of the ultra-thin, micro-rotor Caliber 240. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">For its 50th anniversary in 2018, Patek launched two new versions of the cult-classic model, one in platinum, the other in rose-gold, each with a svelte wrist profile under 6mm. Those models featured sunburst-finished enamel dials, hands and hour appliqués in either white gold or rose gold; inside the 34.5mm x 39.5mm case, mounted on shiny alligator leather straps, was that selfsame Caliber 240, with its 18k gold microrotor and a minimum power reserve of two days.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Golden-Ellipse-2024-side-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712824355"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>What’s New: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Channeling classical vintage models of the Golden Ellipse from the late 1960s and 1970s — particularly the fondly remembered Ref. 3548 from 1968 and Ref. 3605 from 1974 — Patek Philippe introduces the new Ref. 5738/1R-001, swapping out the leather strap of the anniversary editions for a distinctively elegant, gold chain-link bracelet. Patterned after ‘70s-era bracelets like the <em>“Milanais”</em> on the 1968 watch and the <em>“Polonais”</em> on the 1974 edition, the bracelet of the new Golden Ellipse, made of rose gold, is designed to be both comfortably supple and easily adjustable (its gold clasp is equipped with three adjustment notches), constructed of a total of 363 individual parts including more than 300 links; in classical Patek Philippe style, each bracelet is assembled manually.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Golde-Ellipse-bracelet-assembly-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712827551"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The watch’s rose-gold case, measuring 34.5mm x 39.5mm, is the slimmest in Patek Philippe’s collection, at just 5.9mm thick; inside, as has been the case since 1977, is Patek’s <em>manufacture</em> Caliber 240, at a similarly slender profile of just 2.53mm thick. It beats behind an ebony-black sunburst dial with lavishly contrasting rose-gold hands and markers. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Patek-Philippe-Golden-Ellipse-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712827848"></div><strong>When and How Much:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Patek Philippe Golden Ellipse Ref. 5738/1R-001 joins the regular collection in Spring 2024, at a U.S. retail of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">$60,097.</span>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva, the world's biggest watch fair in the world's most cosmopolitan watch city, is in full swing this week, and our team is on the ground covering the highlights from some of your favorite watchmakers. Below, we've collected all the major new releases from Rolex, with a bit of background on each model, details on the newest pieces, and our own on-site photography.</p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Rolex GMT-Master II</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-2024-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712754361" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The Background: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The original Rolex GMT-Master debuted in 1955, developed with the design input of the era’s commercial airline pilots. Now known as the GMT-Master II after a revamp in 1982, the watch is one of the most coveted luxury travel watches on the planet, and basically established the motif that has inspired other dual-time zone timepieces for more than half a century. The original Ref. 6542, was the first watch capable of displaying the time in two separate time zones thanks to its fourth, central 24-hour hand and bidirectional rotating 24-hour GMT bezel. The modern versions of the watch are equipped with Rolex’s in-house Caliber 3285, whose “Superlative Chronometer” certification speaks to the movement’s astounding -2/+2 seconds per day of precision, even stricter than those for COSC chronometer certification.The GMT-Master has become famous for its colorful nicknames, which come from the color combo on the bicolor bezels, including the original red-and-blue “Pepsi,” the black-and-blue “Batman,” and black-and-brown “root beer.” Last year’s new GMT-Master models featured yellow-gold and bimetal “Rolesor” 40mm cases and a new gray-black ceramic bezel.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-jubilee-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712754535" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>What’s New: </strong>Two new GMT-Master II models make their debut in Oystersteel cases, both featuring the same gray-and-black high-tech ceramic bezel introduced on last year’s version. The graduation of the bezel is made even more visible thanks to the use of a PVD treatment on the molded, recessed numbers used for the 24-hour scale. Also displaying Rolex’s traditional level of technical prowess and attention to functional detail, the ceramic used for the bezel is inert and thus will not corrode over time, and its knurled edge makes it easy to grip when switching time zones. The black lacquer dial has the name “GMT-Master” printed in green, echoing the color of the arrow-tipped central GMT hand, which (since the 1982 upgrade) can be adjusted independently of the main hour hand. One model is mounted on Rolex’s classic three-link Oyster bracelet, the other on the five-link Jubilee bracelet, both in Oystersteel (a particularly tough surgical-grade alloy) and equipped with the Oysterlock folding safety clasp and the Easylink extension that allows for 5 mm worth of adjustment. </p><h4><b>Rolex Cosmograph Daytona</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Daytona-2024-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712754709" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In 1962, Rolex became official timekeeper of the Daytona 500, and one year later it released the Ref. 6239 Cosmograph, nicknamed the “Daytona” after the famous Florida racetrack, its now-famous racing-inspired chronograph watch. The watch was notable for its three-register dial and engraved tachymeter bezel. The Daytona, which rose to unprecedented heights of fame and desirability after it became associated with actor and racing driver Paul Newman, has been produced in various versions year after year ever since, forever linked to the high-performance world of motorsport and consistently one of the most coveted watch models in the world. Throughout its history, the Daytona has housed an ever-advancing series of calibers, including, most recently, the in-house Rolex Caliber 4130, with a column-wheel chronograph mechanism and a host of Rolex-patented technical details including a hairspring made of blue Parachrom, an antimagnetic alloy. Last year, for the model’s 60th anniversary, Rolex introduced two new models in “Oystersteel” and platinum, with a host of subtle but significant refinements to their case and dial as well as an all-new automatic movement, Caliber 4131.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What’s New: </strong>For 2024’s latest iterations of the Daytona, Rolex veers away from technical refinement of the engine and leans into lavish adornment of the chassis. Two new models make their debut in 18K white gold, with natural mother-of-pearl dials and 36 brilliant cut diamonds taking the place of the motorsport-inspired tachymeter scale on the bezel. Both 40mm watches model contain the recently introduced Caliber 4131, with a host of Rolex patented features to achieve optimum chronometric performance and industry-leading magnetic resistance; a chronograph feature with a column wheel and vertical clutch system; and a long-weekend-proof 72-hour power reserve. One, with a black mother-of-pearl dial, is model is mounted on an Oyster bracelet in white gold; the other, with a white MOP dial, is on Rolex’s flexible Oysterflex bracelet.</span></p><h4><b>Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Day-Date-2024-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712754891" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Background:</strong> The Rolex Day-Date, introduced in 1956 with Ref. 6510 and 6511, was the first wristwatch that displayed both the date (in the now-familiar 3 o’clock position under the Cyclops lens) and the day of the week (in a curved window above the Rolex logo at 12 o’clock). The Day-Date’s 36mm gold Oyster case had the fluted bezel emblematic of its stylistic predecessor, the Datejust, and housed the automatic Caliber 1055. The Day-Date has been famously nicknamed the “President” since at least the 1960s when President Lyndon B. Johnson wore one regularly in office, and last year, the model provided the canvas for several elegant high-jewelry executions with dials made of precious materials like aventurine, carnelian, and turquoise.</span></p><p><strong>What’s New:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Day-Date 40, the larger, more contemporary version of the classic, unisex Day-Date 36, adopts a “slate ombré” dial, used on this model for the first time by Rolex, whose gradient treatment ranges from gray tones in the center to black at the edge. Also for the first time, the ombre dial features the Daytona’s classical Roman numeral hour markers rather than diamonds as its hour markers. The 40mm case is made of the proprietary Everose gold, the same precious metal used for the bracelet. As traditional for the Day-Date, the dial features a magnifying Cyclops lens over the 3 o’clock date window, and the emblematic fluted bezel. Inside beats the Rolex “perpetual” (i.e. self-winding) Caliber 3255.</span></p><h4><b>Rolex Oyster Perpetual Sky-Dweller</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Sky-Dweller-2024-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712755013" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Sky-Dweller is Rolex’s newest product family, introduced in 2012. It is an annual calendar watch with a cleverly designed in-house movement, Caliber 9001, which employs an off-center, rotating 24-hour disk to indicate a second time zone. The local time, indicated by the central hands, can be adjusted quickly when you change time zones by setting the hour hand forward or backward in one-hour increments without affecting the other indicators. Like other annual calendars (Rolex calls its version a Saros calendar), it’s designed to require adjustment only once per year, at the end of February. In 2023, after several quiet years for the collection, Rolex introduced new Sky-Dwellers in white-gold cases, with upgraded Superlative Chronometer movements, at Watches &amp; Wonders.</span></p><p><strong>What's New:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rolex has launched the Sky-Dweller in two new iterations for 2024, both in 42mm Oyster cases made of 18k gold and both mounted on Jubilee bracelets — a first for the Sky-Dweller model. One of the new Sky-Dwellers combines a case made of Rolex's own Everose gold alloy with a compelling slate-colored dial. the other marries an intense white dial to a case made of yellow gold. Both cases are made from a monobloc of the precious metal, with fine fluting on the bezel edge and caseback, and waterproof to 100 meters. Inside, as in last year's white-gold model, is the recently introduced Rolex in-house Caliber 9002, with automatic winding, a 70-hour power reserve, and the expected host of Rolex-exclusive and patented technical features, including an anti-magnetic nickel phosphorus escapement, a blue Parachrom hairspring, and high-performance Paraflex shock absorbers.</span></p><h4><strong>Rolex Perpetual 1908</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Perpetual-1908-2024-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712755118" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was in the year 1908 that Hans Wilsdorf renamed Wilsdorf &amp; Davis, the watchmaking firm he’d founded with his partner, as Rolex Watch Company Ltd., a name that came to the founder on a carriage ride through London. In that same year, the formerly London-based company was registered in Geneva, Switzerland, where it has been based ever since. That milestone date provides the inspiration and the name for the elegant new family of dress watches unveiled just last year, which adopt many elements of Rolex’s fondly remembered Cellini watches. The first generation featured 39mm gold cases, alligator straps, and a new movement, Caliber 7140, displayed behind a sapphire exhibition caseback.</span></p><p><strong>What’s New:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For 2024, Rolex has unveiled a new Perpetual 1908 model in a platinum case and an elegantly executed ice-blue dial with a guilloché rice-grain motif. The delicate, eye-catching geometrical pattern blossoms in the manner of a rosette on the surface of the dial, which also employs another type of hand-applied guilloché, a crimped, filet sauté pattern, for the minute track. Like the gold version that preceded it in the "new-old" 1908 collection last year, the dial hosts distinctly stylish Arabic applied numerals at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock and faceted hands. The 39mm platinum case measures 39mm in diameter, with a coin-edge bezel and fluted lugs, and contains the self-winding Perpetual Caliber 1704, with a 66-hour power reserve. Also like its predecessor, it comes mounted on a dressy leather strap, here in matte brown with Rolex's double-folding "Dualclasp" in the same platinum as the case.</span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Rolex Oyster Perpetual Deepsea</b></span></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Deepsea-2024-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712758257"></div><p><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolex tripled down on the remarkable water-resistance of the its Sea-Dweller dive watch (itself a more robust extension of the original, iconic Submariner) with the launch of the Sea-Dweller Deepsea in 2008, resurrecting the “Deepsea” moniker of its legendary expedition prototype from 1960, which set a record for underwater watches in the Bathyscaphe Trieste. The original, titanium-cased Deepsea (Ref. 116660) measured a hefty 44mm in diameter and boasted an unheard-of depth rating of 3,990 meters, or 12,800 feet. Rolex achieved the watch’s relatively modest thickness of 18mm, which included a 5mm-thick sapphire crystal, by incorporating some of the technological advances the brand had introduced into its production in the 21st century, especially the patented Ringlock case construction, which uses a hardened, nitrogen-alloy central compression ring to surround the movement while supporting the crystal and the caseback, and a rotating bezel made of Cerachrom, Rolex’s sturdy ceramic material. Deepsea models have since become a third branch of Rolex’s dive-watch family tree, bringing to the table an even higher depth rating than either of their predecessors.</span></p><p><strong>What’s New: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolex embraces luxury in its most defiantly utilitarian tool watch with this year’s version of the Deepsea in full 18k yellow gold, with both the 44mm Oyster case and the three-link Oyster bracelet constructed of the precious metal. Technically, the case combines a middle section from a monobloc of gold, a rotating Cerachrom bezel in blue ceramic with yellow-gold PVD numerals, and a hermetically sealed caseback made of titanium. The case features an automatic helium release valve for saturation diving and an extra-thick crystal (5.5mm) to withstand the crushing depths at which the watch is built to function. The blue lacquered dial has the familiar luminous Mercedes handset and shaped hour markers established way back in the 1950s by the Submariner, here with the inscription “Deepsea” in a contrasting gold powder. The Ringlock system, executed here for the first time in ceramic, securely protects the movement, Rolex’s automatic Caliber 3235, first used in the Sea-Dweller in 2018.</span></p><p></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Zenith has streamlined its various product families while at the same time introducing a range of styles, materials, and colorways to appeal to as wide and diverse an audience as possible. What has been conspicuously absent from the </span><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> lineup for more than a few years, however, has been a purpose-built watch for divers. At Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva 2024, Zenith fills this long-unoccupied niche in its portfolio with the Defy Extreme Diver, the latest extension of the boldly stylish, envelope-pushing Defy collection.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Extreme-Diver-black-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712240395"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Zenith Extreme Diver, launching in two dial color options of black and blue, takes inspiration from a watch originally released in 1969 as part of the first wave of Defy models, the Zenith Ref. A3648, the first dive watch in the collection. At the same time, the watch is unmistakably a member of the modern Defy family, with its hallmark angular case and dodecagonal bezel. The case, measuring 42.5mm, is forged from titanium, a metal prized for its strength-to-weight ratio as well as its resistance to corrosion — including from the salt water this watch is designed to encounter on its undersea missions. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Extreme-Diver-side-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712239237"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the case is rated to a punishing 600 meters of water resistance, just like its vintage predecessor — an impressive feat back in 1969 and still a rarity in dive watches today, especially in models like this one, which include a sapphire-crystal display caseback rather than a solid, sealed back. (Six hundred meters, incidentally, is equivalent to 1,969 feet, making for a utilitarian tribute to the Defy collection’s debut year.)  Further cementing the watch’s “Extreme” bonafides is a helium-release valve built into the case, making it useful for saturation diving. Overall, the Defy Extreme Diver meets the ISO 6425 standards for dive watches, which include international standards for paramagnetism and shock resistance as well as underwater robustness.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Extreme-Diver-lume-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712239279"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The screw-down crown is protected on both its flanks by titanium crown guards. Above the 12-sided fixed bezel is another bezel in ceramic, unidirectional with an engraved dive scale and grooved edges for easy operation with diving gloves. The dial, which color-matches the ceramic bezel on both models and features orange details in homage to the 1969 original,  has an engraved geometric motif of four-pointed stars and a sunburst finish that emanates from the Zenith star emblem at 12 o’clock. The date appears in a window at 3 o’clock and the hands and hour markers feature no less than three distinct pigments of X1 Super-LumiNova — blue, green, and orange — for optimum legibility in the dark or deep underwater. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Extreme-Diver-blue-crown-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712241202"></div><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Zenith’s El Primero Caliber 3620-C beats inside the case, offering a power reserve of 60 hours. This non-chronograph version of the groundbreaking El Primero, outfitted with a paramagnetic escapement with key components made of silicon, boasts the same high frequency as its predecessors (36,000 vph, or 5Hz), giving the watch reliable accuracy to 1/10 second. The Defy Extreme Diver comes on a titanium three-link bracelet, along </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">with two supplied, interchangeable straps: one in Cordura-effect FKM rubber in a dial-matching color, the other an extra-long single-piece NATO-style strap, made of recycled fishing nets and designed to be worn over a wetsuit. The Zenith Defy Extreme Diver will retail for $11,300.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Zenith-Defy-Extreme-Diver-blue-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712240455"></div>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">For the third year in a row, Japan’s Grand Seiko has joined the cavalcade of Swiss (and a few notable German) luxury watchmakers as an exhibiting maison at Watches &amp; Wonders in Geneva, and as in previous years, the brand has unveiled a plethora of new timepieces that range from sporty to elegant, as well as an entirely new in-house movement. Here is a rundown of Grand Seiko’s 2024 highlights.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Evolution 9 Refs. SLGW002 and SLGW003</b></h4><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Two new gents’ dress watches from the Evolution 9 collection, Refs. SLGW002 and SLGW003, feature both the debut of the in-house Caliber 9SA4 and the popular “White Birch” textured dial of previous models. The first hand-wound, high-frequency caliber to join Grand Seiko’s lineup in 50 years, Caliber 9SA4 is also the third movement from Grand Seiko’s Caliber 9S platform, a family established in 2020 with the launch of the automatic Caliber 9SA5, and continued with last year’s Tentagraph movement.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-Evolution-9-white-birch-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712736941" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">It offers a frequency of 10 beats per second, thanks to a highly efficient dual-impulse escapement, and carries a power reserve of 80 hours in two barrels. A rearrangement of the gear train and other parts enables the movement to amass this lengthy power reserve with 15 percent fewer turns of the crown than are required to manually power up its automatic predecessor, Caliber 9SA5. Giving the caliber its distinctive visual charm is the manually winding click mechanism, formed in the shape of a wagtail, a bird native to the area around the Japanese city of Morioka, near Grand Seiko’s Studio Shizukuishui, where the watch is made. Through the sapphire caseback, the wearer can watch the bird-like pecking motion of the click as the movement is wound. Like all Grand Seiko mechanical movements, this one features an elite level of finishing, with a wave pattern on the plates and bridges inspired by Japan’s Shizukuishi River, and a power-reserve indicator incorporated into one of the bridges.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-Evolution-9-white-birch-goldLE-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712737034" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The case that houses the new movement is an understated 38.6mm in diameter and 9.95mm thick, with multifaceted lugs that are narrower than those of previous Evolution 9 watches. In the unlimited edition of the watch (Ref. SLGW003), this case is made of Grand Seiko’s Brilliant Hard Titanium with the brand’s hallmark Zaratsu polishing. Debuting alongside the titanium version (both in August 2024) is a limited edition in a rose-gold case (SLGW002). The crowd-pleasing “white birch” dial on both versions has an elegantly textured surface pattern that takes its inspiration from the bark of white birch trees that grow in northern Japan. The watch in both its iterations comes on a crocodile leather strap with a triple-folding clasp made of the same material as the case. The titanium version of the watch will retail for $10,700, while the rose-gold model, limited to 80 pieces, will be priced at $45,000.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SBG275 Spring Drive Chronograph GMT</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-GMT-Chrono-Red-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712737127" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">While the mechanical, manually wound Caliber 9SA4 becomes the newbie in Grand Seiko’s extensive portfolio of in-house movements, the 9R series of Spring Drive calibers is marking its 20th birthday in 2024, with several special editions in Grand Seiko’s Sport collection with robust, angular cases inspired by the brand’s lion emblem. The SBG275 Spring Drive Chronograph GMT, a limited edition of 700 pieces, features a sunrise-inspired dial with brilliant shades of reds and oranges, achieved by a special patented process called “Optical Multilayer Coating.” The process involves a PVD treatment with several layers of nanoscale film, resulting in a multidimensional effect in which the dial’s hues change depending on the angle of view. The inspiration for the dial, Grand Seiko says, was the colors of sunrise over the Hotaka mountain range in central Japan’s Shinshu province. One of the most complicated Spring Drive movements from the 9R family, Caliber 9R96, does its duty inside the 44.5mm “high intensity” titanium case, powering the watch’s super-accurate 1/10-second chronograph and GMT function. The lion emblem, a longtime symbol of Grand Seiko, finds expression in the case’s claw-like angled lugs that hug the wrist and also decorates the rotor of the Spring Drive caliber, which is on display behind a sapphire caseback. The watch will be available in July 2024, priced at $13,400. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SBGC275 Spring Drive GMT</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-GMT-lion-white-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712753596"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the lion-inspired, 44.5mm high-intensity titanium case is the SBGC275 Spring Drive GMT, which joins the core Sport collection, priced at $10,700. Another Spring Drive movement, Caliber 9R66, animates the watch’s time and date display, dual-time function, and power-reserve indicator, all arranged on a textured white dial that plays on the case’s leonine theme: its wavy, cottony surface is designed to evoke the mane of a lion in bright sunlight. The reddish brown of the GMT hand that sweeps over the dial offers an elegant contrasting element, and joins the hallmark razor-shaped hour and minutes hands typical of Grand Seiko. The bracelet, with its H-shaped links, is made of the same titanium alloy as the case, which is 30 percent lighter than standard titanium. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SBGJ277 Hi-Beat GMT “Snowy Valley”</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-GMT-Snowy-Valley-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712753662"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The other new GMT timepiece from Grand Seiko in 2024 is equipped with the automatic, “Hi-Beat” Caliber 9S86 and features a classical bicolor execution for the 24-hour rotating bezel, with a ring made of sapphire. Nighttime hours are delineated in a forest-green sector, while the daylight hours are in a contrasting white. The bezel’s colors coordinate with the white and off-white shades of the finely molded dial to create a visual effect that Grand Seiko has termed “snowy valley” — referring to the juxtaposition of snow and greenery that is found at high mountain elevations during Japan’s summer months. Caliber 9S86 beats at 36,000 vph, or 10 beats per second, for a high level of precision and also boasts magnetic resistance to 4,800 A/m. The sporty stainless steel case is 44.2mm in diameter, 14.8mm thick, and water resistant to 200 meters. The combination of the rotating GMT bezel and central GMT hand enables the wearer to read the time in up to three different time zones. The watch sells in the U.S. for $6,800. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SBGW314 Re-Creation of First Grand Seiko</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-Re-Creation-SBGW314-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712753844"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">For the latest modern re-creation of the very first Grand Seiko wristwatch (that would be from 1960), Grand Seiko marries an understated, 38mm round case made of 18K rose gold with a deep blue “Starry Night” dial. Limited to just 50 pieces and priced at $26,500, the elegant timepiece contains another Seiko in-house movement, the mechanical, manually wound Caliber 9S64, which stores a 72-hour power reserve and offers an accuracy between +5/-3 seconds per day. The “stars” in the dial’s celestial-inspired dial are the simple, faceted baton indexes and razor hands, all constructed from the same rose gold as the case. </span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">SLGH021 Evolution 9 “Genbi Valley”</b></h4><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Grand-Seiko-Evolution-9-Genbi-Valley-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712753734"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">manufacture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> movement from the automatic “Hi-Beat” 9S family animates the SLGH021 “Genbi Valley” edition, limited to 1,000 pieces and featuring the first instance of the previously described Evolution 9 case executed in the company’s “Ever Brilliant Steel,” said to be the most corrosion-resistant alloy of stainless steel in the world. The Genbi Valley that inspires the watch’s bright blue-green dial is a gorge formed by the erosion of large stones by the Iwai River in Japan’s Iwate Prefecture; it is renowned for the natural beauty of its ravines and waterfalls and is designated as a Place of Scenic Beauty and National Monument of Japan. The 40mm case houses the Caliber 9SA5, with a 36,000-vph frequency and a lengthy 80-hour power reserve. The watch, delivered on an Ever Brilliant Steel” bracelet, retails for $10,400. </span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s biggest event devoted to luxury timepieces, Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva, is in full swing this week, showcasing new watches from more than 50 brands, from industry titans to trend-setting boutique brands and independents. Among the most anticipated new releases, as always, are those from Rolex-owned sport-luxury specialist Tudor. Below we offer a hands-on preview of the year’s most intriguing new Tudor watches of 2024.</span></p><h4 data-mce-fragment="1"><b>Tudor Black Bay “Monochrome”</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-Monochrome-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712733095"></div><p><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Bay collection has been the undisputed flagship of the modern Tudor portfolio since its introduction in 2012. Its appeal to collectors springs from its elegantly melded hodgepodge of elements from several different iterations of the brand’s fondly remembered dive watch, the Oyster Prince Submariner. These include the so-called “snowflake” hour hand, drawn from the Submariner Ref. 7016 from 1969, and the large screw-down crown, with engraved Tudor rose emblem, from the 1958 "Big Crown" model. The geometrical hour markers — round dots and rectangles, with a dominant inverted triangle at 12 o’clock — are derived from Tudor Submariners on the market in the ‘60s and ‘70s. The core Black Bay family, directly descended from the original Heritage models, are sized at 41mm with cases predominantly in steel and dive-scale bezel inserts made of anodized aluminum.</span></p><p><strong>What’s New: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new “Monochrome” edition of the 41mm Black Bay is a sober yet oh-so-sleek iteration of the vintage-inspired sport watch, matching a matte black dial with an anodized aluminum dive-scale bezel in the same hue. Silver-toned indexes and hands, both in the recognizable Black Bay style, provide a sharp and legible contrast. Enthusiasts will also appreciate the smaller details, like the engraved Tudor rose emblem that now appears on the screw-down crown. The most important upgrade occurs on the inside: Tudor has outfitted the new Black Bay with a new, proprietary movement, the automatic Caliber MT5602-U, which achieves its lofty “Master Chronometer” designation by earning certification for its accuracy, robustness, and antimagnetic properties from not one but two prestigious Swiss testing agencies, COSC and METAS. Equipped with a silicon hairspring, the movement delivers the Black Bay a power reserve of 70 hours. Tudor offers the Monochrome edition on either a three-link or five-link steel bracelet as well as a black rubber strap.</span></p><p><strong>How Much and When?</strong><b></b>On the rubber strap, the Black Bay Monochrome retails for $4,225. The bracelet versions sell for $4,425 (on the three-link) and $4,550 (on the five-link). All are available in April 2024.</p><h4><strong>Tudor Black Bay 58 GMT</strong></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-GMT-flat-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712733228"></div><p><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tudor introduced the first Black Bay GMT in 2018, taking the classical design of the Rolex GMT-Master (made by Tudor’s parent company) and giving it a contemporary spin that is also distinctly 21st-Century Tudor. While the Black Bay GMT owes an obvious aesthetic debt to Rolex’s iconic travel watch, it also fits firmly within the design language of the Black Bay, with its bezel sporting a bicolor 24-hour ring on which the wearer can read a second time zone thanks to the dial’s GMT hand. The famous bright red-and-blue “Pepsi” bezel of Rolex’s original GMT-Master is here slightly modified to a more muted indigo-and-burgundy combo. Last year, Tudor expanded the collection with a silvery-grained white-dial version in its original case size of 41mm.</span></p><p><strong>What’s New:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, a GMT model joins the versatile, megapopular subfamily of the Black Bay, the Black Bay 58, whose origins are detailed below, and which has found favor among enthusiasts for its understated 39mm case diameter. The steel case of the Black Bay 58 GMT will fit the bill for many wearers with its 12.8mm thickness and 47.8mm lug-to-lug measurement. Its bicolor 24-hour bezel has a glossier finish for a more vibrant aesthetic, the “snowflake” handset has added layers of Super-LumiNova for legibility, and the movement inside is the automatic Caliber MT5440-U, boasting both a COSC certification as well as a METAS certification as a “Master Chronometer; its power reserve is 65 hours, just shy of the 70 hours offered by the non-GMT-equipped base caliber. The Black Bay 58 GMT comes on either a sporty black rubber strap or the classic Tudor riveted steel bracelet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How much and when?</strong> The Tudor Black Bay 58 GMT retails for $4,400 on a rubber strap and for $4,600 on a steel bracelet. The watch is available in April, launching concurrently with its reveal at Watches &amp; Wonders 2024.</span></p><h4><b>Tudor Black Bay 58 18K</b></h4><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-18K-gold-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712733304"></div><p><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In 2018, in response to growing consumer demand both for more modest case sizes and for greater period authenticity in vintage-style timepieces, Tudor introduced the Black Bay Fifty-Eight, named for the year 1958, in which Tudor released the Oyster Prince Submariner Ref. 7924 “Big Crown,” the most clear forerunner to the Black Bay. That watch matched the 39mm case diameter of that vintage model, which became the default case size of the Oyster Prince shortly after the first models were sized at 37mm. In the past, Tudor has used the Black Bay 58, whose core models are in steel, to delve into other metals such as bronze and even into more upmarket styles in silver and yellow gold.</span></p><p><strong>What’s New:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in 2024, the Black Bay 58 arrives in a full yellow-gold case, the most high-end version also boasting a solid yellow-gold three-link bracelet. Both the case (39mm in diameter and a relatively modest 12.7mm thick) and the bracelet feature a predominantly satin-brushed finish for a luxurious yet non-flashy presentation. The “golden green” of the dial, with its matte-gold details like the familiar geometric indexes and snowflake hands, is a shade specially chosen to resonate harmoniously with the case and the matte-green bezel, made of anodized aluminum. The bracelet, which is minus the retro-style rivets of its steel predecessors, has Tudor’s “T-fit” clasp for easy lengthening and ceramic ball bearings to help ensure a comfortable closure. The movement inside is the COSC-certified automatic MT5400, with bidirectional winding and a 70-hour power reserve.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How Much and When?</strong> The Tudor Black Bay 58 is on sale now for $32,000 in its all-gold bracelet version. At press time, prices had not yet been set for the models on straps, but one can assume they will be somewhat less than those on the bracelet. </span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Vacheron Constantin’s elegantly understated Patrimony collection made its modern debut in 2004 but its stylistic roots come from the 1950s, particularly the Ref. 6179 timepiece from 1957 (below). That watch’s timeless, minimalist appeal came from its simple round case, slender bezel, slightly convex dial with “pearl” minute track, and its legendary vintage movement, Caliber 1003, at the time the world’s thinnest at just 1.64mm high. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-Ref-6719-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712348594"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Patrimony family that sprang from that historical timepiece turns 20 years old in 2024, and took center stage at Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva — with two new manual-winding watches, in white gold and pink gold, and an additional white-gold model that adds a moon-phase display and a retrograde date to the minimalist two-handed time display. The two new Patrimony Manual-Winding models are noteworthy for their new, smaller case diameter — 39mm down from the 40mm of the predecessors, a subtle alteration that is in keeping with the modern trends, especially in dress watches. The convex dial, with its familiar slim, baton hour and minute hands and hour appliqués, adopts a new “old silver” color, finished in a sunburst motif. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-Patrimony-RG-wrist-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712348949"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The emblematic minute track is made up of 48 individual pearls in the same 18k gold as the case. The manual-winding Caliber 1440, which holds a 42-hour power reserve and offers impressive slimness at just 2.6mm thick, is hidden behind a solid caseback in these new Patrimony models, an aesthetic decision made in order to offer personalization to their owners on demand, etched into the caseback in delicate gold engraving. The watches’ alligator leather straps are in new eye-catching colors of azure blue and olive green.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-Patrimony-WG-wrist-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712349028"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The third and most complicated new arrival to the Patrimony family is the Patrimony Moon Phase Retrograde Date, in a 42.5mm white-gold case and also bearing a sunburst “old silver tone” dial. The dial’s elegantly arranged displays, swept over by rose-gold hands, include a moon-phase, in an aperture at 6 o’clock, that is graduated to increments based on the moon’s precise cycle of 29 days, 12 hours and 45 minutes — and thus would require only one manual correction every 122 years.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-Patrimony-MoonPhase-Retrograde-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712349150"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The other standout function is the calendar display, which uses an arrow-tipped retrograde hand to point to the date on a ring of delicate Arabic numerals in the upper part of the dial. Driving all these functions is the self-winding Caliber 2460 R31L, made in-house by Vacheron Constantin at its Geneva atelier, which is visible through the caseback’s sapphire window and features the openworked rotor made of 18k gold and evolving the shape of the Maltese Cross, the maison’s longtime emblem.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Vacheron-Constantin-Patrimony-Retrograde-Moon-CU-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712349396"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing and availability on the new Vacheron Constantin Patrimony watches was unavailable at press time. </span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">After several years of focusing on the growth of its 1970s-inspired, sport-luxury Riviera collection, Baume &amp; Mercier expands the scope to its other product families at 2024’s Watches &amp; Wonders trade fair. Particularly catching our eye at the exhibition in Geneva were two new models joining the Swiss brand’s Clifton collection, the first moon-phase timepieces to be equipped with the in-house Baumatic caliber.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Baume-_-Mercier-Clifton-Moon-Phase-blue-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712167858" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Baume &amp; Mercier Clifton Baumatic Moon Phase Date (Ref. M0A10756 with gradient blue lacquer dial and Ref. M0A10758 with a gradient gray lacquer dial) features the classical round case of the Clifton collection, which takes its inspiration from a vintage watch from the 1950s; made of stainless steel in both iterations, it has a sophisticated array of polished and brushed finishing and a comfortable diameter of 39mm. The lacquered dials have the aesthetic hallmarks of the Clifton series, including the Alpha-shaped hour and minute hands and riveted trapezoid indexes, in addition to the large semicircular aperture at 6 o’clock dominated by the lunar complication and its accompanying analog date display.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Baume-_-Mercier-Clifton-Moon-Phase-gray-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712167901" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">On the blue lacquer dial, the delicately faceted hands and indexes are rhodium-plated, the same finish found on the 6 o’clock date ring and the moon disk, which appears on a dark blue field. The gray-dialed version uses gold plating for these selfsame elements and details; this model’s gold-plated moon disk is on a black starry-sky background. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Baume-_-Mercier-Clifton-Moon-Phase-blue-back-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712167947" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the case, which comes in at a fairly slender 12.9mm in profile, beats the Baumatic Caliber BM14-1975 ACI, the latest generation of the original, self-winding Baumatic movement that emerged from Baume &amp; Mercier’s workshops in 2018. Its noteworthy technical aspects include </span><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">a specially developed construction called TwinSpir, which uses a composite-structure hairspring with a thermo-compensating layer of silicon dioxide over two layers of silicon to limit the escapement’s sensitivity to magnetism and improve its resistance to shocks. In concert with an anchor and escape wheel also made of friction-resistant silicon, the mechanism achieves a power reserve of 120 hours, or five full days, and a magnetic resistance to 1,500 Gauss. Visible through a sapphire pane in the screwed caseback, the movement offers the observant eye an array of </span><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">haute horlogerie</span></i><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> decorations and finishes, including circular bridges, a snailed, sandblasted mainplate, and </span><i data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">côtes de Genève</span></i><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> on the openworked rotor. </span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Baume-_-Mercier-Clifton-Moon-Phase-blue-sweater-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712167987" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Both versions of the Baume &amp; Mercier Clifton Moon Phase Date are delivered on an alligator leather strap with large square scales (in dial-matching black or blue), equipped with a reliable spring bar system that allows for easy interchangeability of the strap without additional tools. Priced at $4,900, the watches are available at retail as of April 2024.</span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Following on the coattails of last year's Watches and Wonders Tudor Black Bay Burgundy release, the brand unveils a new model leaning into a more monochromatic design language. While the Black Bay 54 may have stolen the show last year, and the Black Bay 58 GMT leading the charge for 2024, the meaningful updates made to the Black Bay Burgundy and now Monochrome can not be overlooked as it gives us a glimpse as to where the brand is headed in the future.</span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be blown out of proportion, this model is essentially just a black version of last year's Burgundy release. At the time, we touted that model as the future of Tudor in our in-depth review (</span><a href="https://youtu.be/wTCIEyA8r5M?feature=shared" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="https://youtu.be/wTCIEyA8r5M?feature=shared"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">watch it here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">), noting that the slight change in silhouette, new five-link jubilee-style bracelet, new crown, Tudor T-fit clasp, toothier bezel, and of course Master Chronometer (METAS) certified in-house caliber marked a significant moment for the tentpole collection. Now, with an almost matte black dial and bezel combination backdropping clean silver accents, the Black Bay METAS is being aimed towards the mass market with a more subdued approach. </span></p><div style="text-align: start;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hub-New-Watches-2024-black-bay-landscape_9e89ab61-e112-4e4c-aaf0-a69d1cff33eb_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712670691" alt="" style="float: none;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="float: none;" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Hub-New-Watches-2024-black-bay-landscape_9e89ab61-e112-4e4c-aaf0-a69d1cff33eb_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712670691"></div><br data-mce-fragment="1"><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Featuring no gilt whatsoever, the new design language brings a clean look to the Black Bay, establishing a new baseline for the core collection. The matte black, anodized aluminum bezel insert and black dial seem to blend in a cohesive unit to offer uniformity and excellent legibility. The silver-toned applied indices pop from the stark backdrop surrounding the all-important dial text. Opposing the Tudor Geneve word mark and logo at 12 o'clock are the water-resistance rating of 200 meters and proudly stated Master Chronometer text calling out the in-house caliber powering the watch. </span></p><br data-mce-fragment="1"><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/W_W_2024_Tudor-1_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712670356"></div><br data-mce-fragment="1"><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">As previously called out, the slimmer Black Bay manages to house a significant upgrade within. The METAS-certified in-house automatic caliber MT5602-U brings reliable accuracy rigorously tested to the travel-ready package. Operating at 4Hz, or 28,800 vph, the MT5602-U achieves a healthy power reserve of 70 hours while offering anti-magnetism up to 15,000 gauss thanks in part to the silicon balance spring. The caliber is regulated to -2 to +4 seconds per day, surpassing the previous industry benchmark of COSC and achieving Master Chronometer certification, which sees the movement tested more rigorously than before. </span></p><br data-mce-fragment="1"><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/tudor-m7941a1a0nu-0002_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712670354"></div><br data-mce-fragment="1"><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The dimensional refinement from the Black Bay Burgundy is carried over to this model along with a trio of bracelet and strap options. For the first time, we saw Tudor embrace the jubilee-style five-link bracelet on its dive collection last year. Here again, we see the well-finished and articulated bracelet fitted to the Black Bay Monochrome, equipped with the excellent Tudor T-fit milled clasp. The watch is also available on the more traditional riveted three-link bracelet or black rubber strap, both of which will lend easy adjustment thanks to the inclusion of the T-fit clasp. </span></p><br data-mce-fragment="1"><div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/W_W_2024_Tudor-3_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712670355"></div><br data-mce-fragment="1"><p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most notable change comes in the form of the new wearing dimensions. A constant complaint from enthusiasts who saw the potential of the previous Black Bay GMT was the large sizing dimensions that left the watch off the list of those with medium to smaller wrists. Now sporting the refined case diameter of the Black Bay 58, 39mm, the new Black Bay 58 GMT also went on a bit of a diet, dropping the overall case thickness. At 12.8mm thick with a lug-to-lug of 47.8mm, this new GMT brings about a wearing experience more similar to the original Black Bay 58 that ingratiates the model family with its core audience. It is safe to say that those who loved the design language of the previous generation Black Bay GMT but felt a bit sized out by the 41mm diameter and almost 15mm thickness will flock to this more mass-appealing approach.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/W_W_2024_Tudor-15_a8c8a050-57d4-4f1c-9052-7b2ed6e4fb61_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712670881" style="float: none;"></div><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>How much and when?</strong> The Tudor Black Bay Monochrome retails for $4,400 on a rubber strap and for $4,500 on a steel bracelet. The watch will be available in April, launching concurrently with its reveal at Watches &amp; Wonders 2024.]]>

                <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva, the world’s largest and most important gathering of luxury watch brands, kicks off its 2024 edition today, boasting more than 50 exhibitors. Among them is Tudor, which has introduced the first GMT timepiece in its popular Black Bay 58 series. We take a look at it below.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-GMT-pair-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712662763"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Bay collection has been the undisputed flagship of the modern Tudor portfolio since its introduction in 2012. Its appeal to collectors springs from its elegantly melded hodgepodge of elements from several different iterations of the brand’s fondly remembered dive watch, the Oyster Prince Submariner. These include the so-called “snowflake” hour hand, drawn from the Submariner Ref. 7016 from 1969, and the large screw-down crown, with engraved Tudor rose emblem, from the 1958 "Big Crown" model. The geometrical hour markers — round dots and rectangles, with a dominant inverted triangle at 12 o’clock — are derived from Tudor Submariners on the market in the ‘60s and ‘70s. Tudor introduced the first Black Bay GMT in 2018, taking the classical design of the Rolex GMT-Master (made by Tudor’s parent company) and giving it a contemporary spin that is also distinctly 21st-Century Tudor. While the Black Bay GMT owes an obvious aesthetic debt to Rolex’s iconic travel watch, it also fits firmly within the design language of the Black Bay, with its bezel sporting a bicolor 24-hour ring on which the wearer can read a second time zone thanks to the dial’s GMT hand. The famous bright red-and-blue “Pepsi” bezel of Rolex’s original GMT-Master is here slightly modified to a more muted indigo-and-burgundy combo. Last year, Tudor expanded the collection with a silvery-grained white-dial version in its original case size of 41mm.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-GMT-bracelet-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712663045"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>What’s New:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, a GMT model joins the versatile, mega-popular subfamily of the Black Bay, the Black Bay 58, which derives its name from the year Tudor released the historic Oyster Prince Submariner Ref. 7924, the purest forerunner of the modern Black Bay, and which has found favor among enthusiasts for its understated 39mm case diameter. The steel case of the Black Bay 58 GMT will fit the bill for many wearers with its 12.8mm thickness and 47.8mm lug-to-lug measurement. Its bicolor 24-hour bezel (here in a new burgundy-and-black combo) has a glossier finish for a more vibrant aesthetic, the “snowflake” handset has added layers of Super-LumiNova for legibility, and the movement inside is the automatic Caliber MT5440-U, boasting both a COSC certification as well as a METAS certification as a “Master Chronometer; its power reserve is 65 hours, just shy of the 70 hours offered by the non-GMT-equipped base caliber. The Black Bay 58 GMT comes on either a sporty black rubber strap or the classic Tudor riveted steel bracelet.</span></p><div style="text-align: left;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-GMT-strap-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712663092" alt="" style="float: none;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="float: none;" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Tudor-Black-Bay-58-GMT-strap-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712663092"></div><br data-mce-fragment="1"><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>How much and when?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> The Tudor Black Bay 58 GMT retails for $4,400 on a rubber strap and for $4,600 on a steel bracelet. The watch is available in April, launching concurrently with its reveal at Watches &amp; Wonders 2024. </span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Watches and Wonders, the world’s biggest exhibition of new timepieces, kicks off today in Geneva, and we are on site at the show to cover the most exciting and significant new releases from some of your favorite brands — starting with Rolex, which offers among its newest releases the newest version of its Sky-Dweller in 18k rose gold.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Sky-Dweller-RG-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712651993" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p></p><p><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Background:</strong> The Sky-Dweller is Rolex’s newest product family, introduced in 2012. It is an annual calendar watch with a cleverly designed in-house movement, Caliber 9001, which employs an off-center, rotating 24-hour disk to indicate a second time zone. The local time, indicated by the central hands, can be adjusted quickly when you change time zones by setting the hour hand forward or backward in one-hour increments without affecting the other indicators. Like other annual calendars (Rolex calls its version a Saros calendar), it’s designed to require adjustment only once per year, at the end of February. In 2023, after several quiet years for the collection, Rolex introduced new Sky-Dwellers in white-gold cases, with upgraded Superlative Chronometer movements, at Watches &amp; Wonders.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Sky-Dweller-YG-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712652032" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What's New:</strong> Rolex has launched the Sky-Dweller in two new iterations for 2024, both in 42mm Oyster cases made of 18k gold and both mounted on Jubilee bracelets — a first for the Sky-Dweller model. One of the new Sky-Dwellers combines a case made of Rolex's own Everose gold alloy with a compelling slate-colored dial. the other marries an intense white dial to a case made of yellow gold. Both cases are made from a monobloc of the precious metal, with fine fluting on the bezel edge and caseback, and waterproof to 100 meters. Inside, as in last year's white-gold model, is the recently introduced Rolex in-house Caliber 9002, with automatic winding, a 70-hour power reserve, and the expected host of Rolex-exclusive and patented technical features, including an anti-magnetic nickel phosphorus escapement, a blue Parachrom hairspring, and high-performance Paraflex shock absorbers. </span></p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watches and Wonders, the world’s biggest exhibition of new timepieces, kicks off today at the Palexpo in Geneva. We are on site at the show to cover the most exciting and significant new releases from some of your favorite brands. In this article we give a preview of Rolex’s newest elegant dress watch, the Perpetual 1908. </span></p><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The Background:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> It was in the year 1908 that Hans Wilsdorf renamed Wilsdorf &amp; Davis, the watchmaking firm he’d founded with his partner, as Rolex Watch Company Ltd., a name that came to the founder on a carriage ride through London. In that same year, the formerly London-based company was registered in Geneva, Switzerland, where it has been based ever since. That milestone date provides the inspiration and the name for the elegant new family of dress watches unveiled just last year, which adopt many elements of Rolex’s fondly remembered Cellini watches. The first generation featured 39mm gold cases, alligator straps, and a new movement, Caliber 7140, displayed behind a sapphire exhibition caseback. </span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Perpetual-1908-platinum-front-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712650277" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>What’s New:</strong> For 2024, Rolex has unveiled a new Perpetual 1908 model in a platinum case and an elegantly executed ice-blue dial with a guilloché rice-grain motif. The delicate, eye-catching geometrical pattern blossoms in the manner of a rosette on the surface of the dial, which also employs another type of hand-applied guilloché, a crimped, filet sauté pattern, for the minute track. </p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Perpetual-1908-platinum-dial-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712650320" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1">Like the gold version that preceded it in the "new-old" 1908 collection last year, the dial hosts distinctly stylish Arabic applied numerals at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock and faceted hands. The 39mm platinum case measures 39mm in diameter, with a coin-edge bezel and fluted lugs, and contains the self-winding Perpetual Caliber 1704, with a 66-hour power reserve. Also like its predecessor, it comes mounted on a dressy leather strap, here in matte brown with Rolex's double-folding "Dualclasp" in the same platinum as the case.</p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-Perpetual-1908-platinum-back-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712650375" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watches and Wonders, the world’s biggest exhibition of new timepieces, kicks off today at the Palexpo in Geneva. We are on site at the show to cover the most exciting and significant new releases from some of your favorite brands. Leading off, as you might expect, is Rolex, which has released two new versions of its iconic two-time-zone <strong>GMT-Master II</strong> in steel cases and bicolor ceramic bezels.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-Oyster-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712647745" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The Background:</strong><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The original Rolex GMT-Master turns 70 years old in 2024. Now known as the GMT-Master II after a revamp in 1982, the watch is one of the most coveted luxury travel watches on the planet, and basically established the motif that has inspired other dual-time zone timepieces for more than half a century. The original Ref. 6542, was the first watch capable of displaying the time in two separate time zones thanks to its fourth, central 24-hour hand and bidirectional rotating 24-hour GMT bezel. The modern versions of the watch are equipped with Rolex’s in-house Caliber 3285, which boasts no less than 10 patent applications and includes proprietary innovations like the antimagnetic  blue Parachrom hairspring and the energy efficient Chronergy escapement. Its “Superlative Chronometer” certification speaks to the movement’s astounding -2/+2 seconds per day of precision, even stricter than those for COSC chronometer certification.The GMT-Master has become famous for its colorful nicknames, which come from the color combo on the bicolor bezels, including the original red-and-blue “Pepsi,” the black-and-blue “Batman,” and black-and-brown “root beer.” Last year’s new GMT-Master models featured yellow-gold and bimetal “Rolesor” 40mm cases and a new gray-black ceramic bezel.</span></p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-2024-Jubilee-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712647791" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>What’s New:</strong><b data-mce-fragment="1"></b>Two new GMT-Master II models make their debut in Oystersteel cases, both featuring the same gray-and-black high-tech ceramic bezel introduced on last year’s version. The graduation of the bezel is made even more visible thanks to the use of a PVD treatment on the molded, recessed numbers used for the 24-hour scale. Also displaying Rolex’s traditional level of technical prowess and attention to functional detail, the ceramic used for the bezel is inert and thus will not corrode over time, and its knurled edge makes it easy to grip when switching time zones. The black lacquer dial has the name “GMT-Master” printed in green, echoing the color of the arrow-tipped central GMT hand, which (since the 1982 upgrade) can be adjusted independently of the main hour hand. One model is mounted on Rolex’s classic three-link Oyster bracelet, the other on the five-link Jubilee bracelet, both in Oystersteel (a particularly tough surgical-grade alloy) and equipped with the Oysterlock folding safety clasp and the Easylink extension that allows for 5 mm worth of adjustment.</p><div style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/9723/3501/files/Rolex-GMT-Master-II-2024-dialCU-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1712648089" alt="" style="float: none;"></div><div style="text-align: start;">Pricing and availability was unavailable at press time. So what do you think the nickname for the new black-and-gray bezel combo should be? My first thought is "Siilver Bullet." Feel free to add yours to the comments. </div>]]>
